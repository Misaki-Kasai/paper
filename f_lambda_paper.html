  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Structural Note on the Variational Section</h2>
  <p>This model intentionally adopts a quasi-solution \(\phi(r)\), rather than an exact solution. The reason is that an exact solution would eliminate the physical significance of the characteristic scale <span style="font-style: normal;">r = R</span>, thereby preventing the reproduction of the essential behavior: scale-responsive structure of space. If an exact solution were enforced, the parameter <span style="font-style: normal;">r = R</span> would likely be absorbed into coordinate redefinitions or symmetry-induced degeneracies. In such a case, <span style="font-style: normal;">R</span> would lose its status as a physically anchored scale and instead become a redundant parameter, thereby obscuring any meaningful scale-dependent structure in the resulting dynamics.<br>Being a quasi-solution is not a weakness but the structural foundation of the model—it is the key to realizing scale-dependent spatial dynamics.<br>To verify the validity of this quasi-solution, we conducted a variational residual analysis. The results show that the deviation is well-controlled, localized, and physically meaningful. This behavior is also visually illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>Please do not mistake the use of a quasi-solution for a flaw or a compromise. It is not a shortcoming, but the core of the theory and the very foundation of its structure.<br>Importantly, the quasi-solution is not adopted for approximation, but for its structural role in deriving the effective cosmological term <span style="font-style: normal;">Λ<sub>eff</sub>(r)</span>.<br>It does not imply that the entire structure of the universe or the fundamental field equations themselves are quasi-solutions. The aim of this study is to examine whether a quasi-structural term like <span style="font-style: normal;">Λ<sub>eff</sub>(r)</span> can function effectively within a universe that is otherwise governed by exact solutions.</p>
  <p>This quasi-solution structure has been confirmed to bridge both the cosmological scale (~\(10^{26}\,\text{m}\)) and the Higgs scale (~\(10^{-18}\,\text{m}\)). (See Appendix for the numerical evaluation related to the Higgs sector.)</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2><p>In this study, we propose an extension of the Einstein field equations by introducing a repulsive gravity framework based on the scale-responsive geometric repulsion effect of space, derived from a scalar field. This effect is modeled as a logarithmic-type potential structure, from which a scale-dependent effective cosmological term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), is derived. The impact of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) depends on spatial scale, potentially redefining the structural properties of gravity especially at galactic scales and within black hole interiors. We demonstrate that two key observational and theoretical challenges—the flattening of galactic rotation curves in their outer regions and the avoidance of black hole singularities—can be addressed in a unified and quantitative manner through the common scalar-field-derived term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\).</p>
<h2>Overview of the Galactic Rotation Curve Problem and the Singularity Problem</h2><p>Recent astronomical observations have revealed that the rotational velocities of stars in the outer regions of galaxies significantly exceed the values predicted by gravitational theory (general relativity) combined with the observed amount of baryonic matter. This discrepancy is known as the <em>galactic rotation curve problem</em>. It has long been considered difficult to account for this phenomenon without invoking the existence of dark matter <span style="color: blue;">[Rubin, V. C., & Ford, W. K. (1980). <em>Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Regions</em>. The Astrophysical Journal]; [Sofue, Y., & Rubin, V. (2001). <em>Rotation Curves of Spiral Galaxies</em>. Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gravitational collapse inside black holes is known, in the classical framework, to lead to a singularity—i.e., a region of infinite curvature—in the limit \(r \to 0\). This phenomenon is considered to signal the breakdown or limitation of general relativity itself <span style="color: blue;">[Penrose, R. (1965). <em>Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities</em>. Physical Review Letters]</span>. The so-called <em>singularity problem</em> strongly suggests the necessity of quantum corrections or structural modifications within gravitational theory.</p>
<h2>Successes and Limitations of the \(\Lambda\)CDM Model</h2><p>The \(\Lambda\)CDM model, which serves as the standard framework in modern cosmology, has achieved remarkable success in explaining observational data such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae with high precision <span style="color: blue;">[Planck Collaboration (2020). <em>Planck 2018 Results. VI. Cosmological Parameters</em>. Astronomy & Astrophysics]</span>. However, the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) is defined as a static and uniform quantity, without incorporating any spatial structure or scale dependence.</p><p>Moreover, although \(\Lambda\)CDM relies on invisible components such as dark matter and dark energy, the true nature of these entities remains unknown. They function as auxiliary terms in the theoretical framework, and there has been persistent criticism that they lack a solid basis for physical reality <span style="color: blue;">[Padmanabhan, T. (2003). <em>Cosmological Constant—The Weight of the Vacuum</em>. Physics Reports]</span>.</p>
<h2>Motivation: Constructing a Cosmological Framework with Repulsion as the Subject</h2>
<p>This study attempts to construct a gravitational theory in which <strong>repulsive response is the subject</strong>, in contrast to general relativity, which treats “gravity = attraction” as its primary perspective.</p><p>Specifically, we propose a framework that introduces an effective cosmological constant term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), derived from a scalar field, which acts as a scale-dependent repulsive potential. This enables a unified description of gravitational structures ranging from galactic scales to black hole singularity scales.</p><p>It should be noted that this study adopts the stance of preserving the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) in the Einstein field equations as a true constant. However, its effect manifests in a scale-dependent manner through a logarithmic-type potential, and is therefore reflected in the observable gravitational structure as \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\). In this way, the aim is to construct a gravitational theory that retains the philosophical foundation of the \(\Lambda\)CDM model while overcoming its structural limitations.</p>
<h2 id="section4">Structure of the Effective Term Λ<sub>eff</sub> and Derivation from the Scalar Field Potential</h2><p>In this section, we demonstrate that the effective \(\Lambda\) term</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2}
\]<p>is structurally derived from a variational principle applied to a spherically symmetric and static scalar field.</p><p>Here, \(R\) is a characteristic scale of space and corresponds to the radial position at which the effective term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) reaches its maximum. It serves as a physically meaningful parameter in this framework.</p><p>The scalar field \(\phi\) considered in this study is rigorously defined based on a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian density. In its general form, this Lagrangian is given by</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial_\nu \phi - V(\phi),
\]<p>where \(V(\phi)\) is the scalar potential. However, restricting ourselves to a spherically symmetric and static configuration \(\phi = \phi(r)\), we simplify the Lagrangian to the form</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 - V(\phi).
\]<p>This reduction is justified as an effective theory based on the symmetry of the solution and does not imply a violation of the original Lorentz invariance of the full Lagrangian.</p><p>In this context, the isotropic structure of the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is given by:</p>
\[
T_{\mu\nu}^{(\phi)} = \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 + V(\phi) \right] g_{\mu\nu}.
\]<p>We now assume the following form for the effective cosmological term, which depends on spatial scale:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2}.
\]<p>A natural choice of scalar field that reproduces this structure is:</p>
\[
\phi(r) = \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2}.
\]<p>Using this expression for \(\phi(r)\), the corresponding potential \(V(\phi(r))\) expands as follows:</p>
\[
\phi(r)^2 = \left( \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2} \right)^2 = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
= -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \left( 4 - \frac{4R^2 r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \right),
\]
\[
= -\frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} + \underbrace{\frac{4R^2 r^4}{(R^2 + r^2)^4}}_{\text{Second-order correction term}}.
\]<p>Here, the second term serves as a correction that slightly modifies the primary structure of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), but the leading term clearly satisfies the relation:</p>
\[
\boxed{V(\phi(r)) \propto -\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)}.
\]<p>In particular, in the regime \(r \ll R\), the correction term is significantly smaller than the leading term. In the opposite limit \(r \gg R\), we observe the following asymptotic behaviors:</p>
\[
\frac{r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \approx \frac{1}{r^2}, \quad \frac{r^4}{(R^2 + r^2)^4} \approx \frac{1}{r^4},
\]<p>indicating that the contribution from the correction term decays rapidly.</p><p>Furthermore, even at the intermediate scale \(r = R\), we find:</p>
\[
\frac{4R^2}{(2R^2)^2} = \frac{1}{R^2}, \quad
\frac{4R^2 R^4}{(2R^2)^4} = \frac{1}{4R^2},
\]<p>showing that the correction term remains only one-fourth of the leading term.</p><p>Therefore, across all spatial scales, the leading term dominates, and it is demonstrated that \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) can be directly and naturally derived from the scalar field potential \(V(\phi)\).</p>
<h2>Variational Evaluation of the Scalar Field</h2><p>In this section, we evaluate whether the Lagrangian of the scalar field \(\phi(r)\), derived from the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) constructed in <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, satisfies the extremum condition based on the variational principle (Euler–Lagrange equation). In particular, we expect that the extremum condition is locally violated around the spatial scale \(r = R\), and that this violation rapidly diminishes for \(r \gg R\).</p><p>Such behavior is naturally anticipated from the structure of the adopted \(\phi(r)\), and it also corresponds to the notion that cosmic acceleration may be closely related to a local violation of the extremum condition.</p><p>Note that the violation of the extremum condition discussed here does not directly imply a violation of the conservation law \(\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu} = 0\).</p>
<h3>Euler–Lagrange Equation and Variational Residual</h3><p>In <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, the following scalar field was adopted as a natural candidate for reproducing the spatial dependence of the effective cosmological constant, based on the structure of the scalar potential \( V(\phi) \):</p>
\[
\phi(r) = \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>The corresponding potential takes the following form:</p>
\[
V(\phi) = -\frac{1}{4} \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
\]<p>Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, the Lagrangian density becomes:</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 - V(\phi)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4} \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
\]<p>The Euler–Lagrange equation derived from this Lagrangian is:</p>
\[
\frac{d^2\phi}{dr^2} = R^2 \phi^3 - 2\phi
\]<p>Here, in order to evaluate how well the assumed scalar field \(\phi(r)\) satisfies the extremum condition, we conduct the analysis under the following boundary conditions:</p>
\[
\phi(0) = 0, \quad \phi'(0) = \frac{2}{R^2}
\]<p>with the characteristic scale \(R = 2\), which is chosen because it highlights the features of the scalar field structure and the behavior of the effective \(\Lambda\) term most clearly, while also ensuring clarity in the analytical results and numerical plots.</p><p>Under these conditions, the deviation from the extremum condition (the variational residual) is defined as follows:</p>
\[
\delta(r) \equiv \frac{d^2\phi}{dr^2} - \left( R^2 \phi^3 - 2\phi \right)
\]<p>By substituting the assumed scalar field \(\phi(r)\) into this expression, the variational residual is explicitly given by:</p>
\[
\delta(r) = 
\left[
\frac{4r(r^2 - 3R^2)}{(R^2 + r^2)^3}
\right]
-
\left[
\frac{8R^2 r^3}{(R^2 + r^2)^3} - \frac{4r}{R^2 + r^2}
\right]
\]<p>Based on this expression, the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) for the scalar field \(\phi(r)\) was numerically evaluated. The resulting plots, including a close-up view, are shown in Fig. 1.</p>

       style="width:100%; height:auto;">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1: Variational residual \(\delta(r)\) for the adopted scalar field \(\phi(r)\).</figcaption>
</figure><p>From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) begins to locally deviate at the spatial scale \(r = R\), reaches a peak shortly thereafter (\( r &gt; R \)), and then rapidly decays. This result indicates that the scalar field specifically recognizes and responds to \(r = R\), and that the violation of the extremum condition is local and non-instantaneous. Such behavior is also consistent with the nature of the sustained cosmic acceleration.</p><p>The range of analysis is set to \( r \in [0.0001, 100] \). Within this interval, the maximum value of the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) is found to be:</p>
\[
\delta_{\text{max}} \approx 0.552 \quad \text{at} \quad r \approx 4.10 \approx R
\]<p>To evaluate the significance of this residual, we define the relative error with respect to the extremum condition as:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi(r) \equiv \left| \frac{\delta(r)}{\phi(r)} \right|
\]<p>At the point where the residual peaks (\(r \approx 4.10\)), the scalar field takes the value \(\phi(r) \approx 0.394\), yielding:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi \approx 1.40
\]<p>Similarly, at the characteristic scale \(r = R = 2.00\), the relative error is:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi(R) = \left| \frac{\delta(R)}{\phi(R)} \right| = 0.750 \quad (\delta(R) = 0.375,\ \phi(R) = 0.500)
\]<p>Even around the characteristic scale \( r = R \), the relative error remains within a range that can be regarded as a local violation of the extremum condition.</p>
<p>The value \( \epsilon_\phi(R) = 0.750 \) supports the validity of the function as a quasi-solution.</p><p>On the other hand, the variational residual \( \delta(r) \) reaches its maximum around \( r \approx 4.10 \), where the relative error rises to approximately \( \epsilon_\phi \approx 1.40 \).</p>
<p>However, since \( \phi(r) \) becomes small at this scale, the relative error is numerically overestimated due to the small denominator.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is more appropriate to evaluate the validity of the quasi-solution primarily around \( r = R \).</p><p>Based on these considerations, the scalar field \( \phi(r) \) adopted in this study, while not an exact solution, can be regarded as a physically acceptable quasi-solution that does not significantly violate the variational principle.</p><p>In this paper, we refer to the structure based on the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\), constructed from the quasi-solution \(\phi(r)\), as the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model (or the f\(\Lambda\) theory).</p>
<h2 id="section6">Consistency Between the Maximum of Λ<sub>eff</sub> and the Observed Cosmological Constant Λ</h2>
<p>The derived scale-dependent effective cosmological term,</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]<p>attains its maximum at \(r = R\), with the value given by</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}} = \left. \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \right|_{r=R} 
= \frac{4R^2}{(R^2 + R^2)^2} 
= \frac{4R^2}{4R^4} 
= \frac{1}{R^2}.
\]<p>If this maximum is identified with the observed cosmological constant,</p>
\[
\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}\,\text{m}^{-2},
\]<p>then it follows that</p>
\[
R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} \approx 10^{26}\,\text{m},
\]<p>which coincides with the current observational scale of the visible universe (approximately \(10^{26}\) meters, or about 10 billion light-years).</p><p>This result implies that the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), derived from the scalar field structure proposed in this study, is naturally consistent with the observed value of the cosmological constant. It supports the interpretation of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) as a physically viable candidate for the origin of cosmic repulsion.</p>
<h2>Implications and the Extended Einstein Field Equations</h2><p>The modified Einstein field equation corresponding to this effective energy density is written as:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) g_{\mu\nu} + G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})},
\]
or, equivalently, with \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) moved to the right-hand side:
\[
G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})} - \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) g_{\mu\nu}.
\]<p>At local scales, such as within the solar system, the following condition holds:</p>
\[
\frac{\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)}{\kappa T_{\mu\nu}} \ll 1,
\]<p>which naturally reduces the modified equation to the standard Einstein field equation.</p><p>Therefore, the theory remains consistent with well-established observations that are precisely explained by general relativity, such as the perihelion precession of Mercury and the gravitational redshift.</p>
<h2>Application to Galactic Rotation Curves and the Effective Energy of the \(\Lambda\) Term</h2>
<h3>(1) Gravitational Term: Realistic Approximation Model (Spherically Symmetric Uniform Density)</h3><p>In the central region of a galaxy, the baryonic matter is relatively concentrated, allowing the use of a spherically symmetric and uniform density approximation. Under this assumption, the mass \(M(r)\) enclosed within a radius \(r\) is given by:</p>
\[
\rho = \text{const} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho.
\]<p>From the gravitational potential generated by this mass distribution, the rotational velocity is derived as:</p>
\[
v_{\text{grav}}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{G M(r)}{r}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho} \cdot r
\quad \Rightarrow \quad v_{\text{grav}}(r) \propto r.
\]<p>This result is consistent with the linear increase in rotational velocity observed in the inner regions of galactic rotation curves. Indeed, observations show that near the galactic center, the rotational velocity tends to follow \(v \propto r\), making this model a good approximation in the gravity-dominated region of the galactic core.</p>
<h3>(2) Repulsive Term: Rotational Velocity from the \(\Lambda\) Term and logarithmic-type Extension</h3><p>While the gravitational term from the uniform density model dominates in the central region of galaxies, explaining the flattened rotation curves in the outer regions requires a different dynamical contribution.</p><p>In the present model, we assume that a scale-dependent effective \(\Lambda\) term, derived from a scalar field associated with a logarithmic-type potential, produces a repulsive effect on space. This effect contributes to the squared rotational velocity in the following form:</p>
\[
v_{\text{rep}}^2(r) = v_0^2 \cdot \frac{2r^2}{R^2 + r^2},
\]<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(v_0\) is a characteristic velocity scale associated with the repulsive term,</li>
  <li>which becomes dominant in the outer galactic region (\(r \gg R\)).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on observational data, we adopt a representative value of \(v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s}\). Since this function contributes negligibly near the center and asymptotically approaches a constant value \(v_{\text{rep}} \to v_0\) as \(r \to \infty\), it naturally reproduces the observed flattening of galactic rotation curves.</p>
<h3>(3) Rotational Velocity from Energy Composition</h3><p>In this model, the gravitational and repulsive contributions to the rotational velocity are regarded as independent energy components. Therefore, the observed rotational velocity is expressed as a quadratic energy sum:</p>
\[
v_{\text{total}}^2(r) = v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
v_{\text{total}}(r) = \sqrt{v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r)}.
\]<p>This composite structure implies that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the inner region, \(v_{\text{grav}} \propto r\) dominates,</li>
  <li>While in the outer region, \(v_{\text{rep}} \to v_0\) flattens the rotation curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework demonstrates that the essential features of galactic rotation curves can be reproduced without assuming the existence of dark matter, thereby supporting the validity of the effective \(\Lambda\) term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\).</p>
<h3>(4) Deriving the Velocity v₀ ≈ 200 km/s from the Effective Energy of Λ<sub>eff</sub>(r)</h3><p>The characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \) can be derived from the result of <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> and the energy density of space in the \( \Lambda \)CDM model, which is given by</p>
\[
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8\pi G} \approx 10^{-26} \, \text{kg/m}^3.
\]<p>By integrating this density over a spherically symmetric region of radius \( R \approx 1000\,\text{kpc} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{22}\,\text{m} \), we obtain the effective mass:
\[
M_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \approx 10^{42} \, \text{kg}.
\]<p>If we convert the entire energy associated with this mass into kinetic energy, the result is:</p>
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} M_\Lambda v_0^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2E}{M_\Lambda}} \approx 200\,\text{km/s}.
\]<p>Therefore, the characteristic velocity \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) is naturally derived within the framework of the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model, and the corresponding energy \( E \) is consistent with the typical observational energy scale \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \). Considering that the total vacuum energy is given by \( E_\Lambda = M_\Lambda c^2 \approx 10^{59}\,\mathrm{J} \), the energy scale \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \) is sufficiently small in comparison, ensuring energetic consistency. These results quantitatively support the physical plausibility of the scale-dependent term \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \), derived from the scalar field, as an effective cosmological repulsive component.</p>
<h3>(5) Physical Interpretation: Dominant Structures by Region</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Central region</strong> (\( r &lt; R \)): The gravitational term dominates, with \(v_{\text{grav}} \propto r\).</li>
  <li><strong>Intermediate region</strong> (\(r \approx R\)): The repulsive term \(v_{\text{rep}}\) becomes dominant, flattening the rotation velocity.</li>
  <li><strong>Outer region</strong> (\( r &gt; R \)): The rotation velocity slowly decays or rises again, reflecting the logarithmic-type structure and scale dependence of \(\Lambda\).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Representative Parameters and Plotting Conditions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gravitational constant: \(G = 4.302 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{kpc \cdot (km/s)^2 / M_\odot}\)</li>
  <li>Mass density (average over the galaxy): \(\rho = 10^6 \, M_\odot/\mathrm{kpc^3}\)</li>
  <li>Scale parameter: \(R = 5 \, \mathrm{kpc}\)</li>
  <li>Repulsive velocity scale: \(v_0 = 200 \, \mathrm{km/s}\)</li>
  <li>Radial range for calculation: \(r = 0.1 \sim 20 \, \mathrm{kpc}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the above representative values, the numerically plotted rotation velocity profile at the galactic scale is shown in Fig. 2, based on the previously derived composite formula:</p>
\[
v_{\text{total}}(r) = \sqrt{v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r)}.

  <figcaption>Fig. 2: Numerical simulation of gravitational, repulsive, and total rotational velocity components for a galactic rotation curve.</figcaption>
</figure><p>As clearly demonstrated by the numerical simulation results shown in Fig. 2, it was initially expected that the gravitational term would dominate in the central region \( r &lt; R \). However, the repulsive component was quantitatively found to exceed the gravitational component across all spatial scales. This indicates that the rotational velocity within galaxies is effectively governed by the scalar-field-induced effective \(\Lambda\) term, characterized by its logarithmic-type structure.</p><p>This result not only explains the observed flattening of rotational velocities in the outer regions of galaxies, but also reveals that the repulsive term significantly contributes even in the central region. It strongly supports the possibility that the scale-dominant behavior of the logarithmic-type repulsive term extends far more broadly than previously anticipated.</p>
<h2>Avoidance Conditions for Black Hole Singularities</h2>
<p>As a scale-dependent repulsive force derived from the quasi-solution scalar field \(\phi(r)\), we introduce the following acceleration term:</p>
\[
a(r) = \frac{2c_0 r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>Here, \(c_0\) is a repulsive potential coefficient (unit: \(\mathrm{m^2/s^2}\)), representing the spatial energy scale of the repulsive field.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Inside the black hole, the repulsive acceleration acts spherically symmetrically and is assumed to balance the gravitational acceleration just before the singularity is reached.</p><p><strong>Balance Condition Between Repulsive and Gravitational Forces:</strong> Under this assumption, the balance condition is expressed as:</p>
\[
\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{2c_0 r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>where \(M\) denotes the mass of the black hole.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Condition:</strong> By adopting \(R = r\) as the characteristic scale, the balance condition simplifies to:<br>(The reason for adopting \( r = R \) (\( R = r \)) is that the function \(a(r)\) reaches its maximum at \( r = R \).)</p>
\[
\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{c_0}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_0 = \frac{GM}{r}
\]<p><strong>Critical Condition for Singularity Avoidance:</strong> We define the critical radius \(r_{\text{crit}}\) at which the repulsive energy equals the total mass-energy of the black hole.</p><p>The repulsive energy is given by:</p>
\[
E_{\text{rep}} = M \cdot c_0 = \frac{GM^2}{r}
\]<p>The mass-energy of the black hole is:</p>
\[
E_{\text{BH}} = M c^2
\]<p>This model assumes that the repulsive response of space is induced by the black hole’s own mass-energy. Thus, the model can be treated as a closed system.</p>
<p>Under this assumption, the principle of energy conservation implies that the repulsive energy accumulated within the black hole cannot exceed the total mass-energy of the black hole.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting the two energies equal yields the critical radius at which collapse becomes energetically impossible:</p>
\[
E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{GM^2}{r_{\text{crit}}} = M c^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{GM}{c^2}
\]<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This result implies that the collapse of a black hole naturally halts at a finite scale, which is determined solely by the mass \(M\), gravitational constant \(G\), and the speed of light \(c\).</p><p>This critical radius exactly corresponds to half the Schwarzschild radius:</p>
\[
r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{1}{2} r_s, \quad \text{where} \quad r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]<p>Thus, the singularity is autonomously avoided not by an external cutoff, but by the internal repulsive structure of space itself within the theory.</p>
<p>(Since the condition \(M c_0 = M c^2\) (\(E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}}\)) is satisfied at the critical radius, it follows that \(c_0 = c^2\) at that point. Consequently, singularities are prohibited by the principle of energy conservation and the speed-of-light limit.)</p>
<h2>Consistency with the Higgs Mechanism</h2><p>In this section, we show that the vacuum expectation value and mass term derived from the potential</p>
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
= -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4
\]<p>defined in <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, match those of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model.</p><p>In the Standard Model, the effective potential for the Higgs mechanism is given by:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4
\]<p>The vacuum expectation value \( v \) in this structure is determined by the extremum condition:</p>
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{d\phi} \right|_{\phi = v} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}
\]
<h3>Vacuum Expectation Value</h3><p>Differentiating the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) in the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model yields:</p>
\[
\frac{dV}{d\phi} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \phi(-2 + R^2 \phi^2) = 0
\]<p>Therefore, the solutions are:</p>
\[
\phi = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \phi = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Thus, excluding the trivial solution \( \phi = 0 \), the vacuum expectation value in the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model is:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}, \quad \phi = \pm v
\]<p>Now, in order to demonstrate the consistency, we compare the coefficients of the quadratic and quartic terms between \( V(\phi(r)) \) and \( V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) \), and obtain:</p>
\[
-\phi^2 \leftrightarrow -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu^2 = 2
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4 \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = R^2
\]<p>Therefore, the position of the minimum in the Standard Model is:</p>
\[
\phi = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{R^2}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Thus, the vacuum expectation value is:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Hence, the vacuum expectation value \( v \) is identical in both models.</p>
<h3>Mass Term</h3><p>For convenience, we restate the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) introduced earlier:</p>
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right) = -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4
\]<p>To extract the physical mass term \( m^2 \), we compute the second derivative of the potential and evaluate it at \( \phi = 0 \):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: First derivative</strong></p>
\[
\frac{dV}{d\phi}
= \frac{d}{d\phi} \left( -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4 \right)
= -2\phi + R^2 \phi^3
\]<p><strong>Step 2: Second derivative</strong></p>
\[
\frac{d^2 V}{d\phi^2}
= \frac{d}{d\phi} \left( -2\phi + R^2 \phi^3 \right)
= -2 + 3R^2 \phi^2
\]<p><strong>Step 3: Evaluation at \( \phi = 0 \)</strong></p>
\[
\left. \frac{d^2 V}{d\phi^2} \right|_{\phi = 0}
= -2 + 3R^2 \cdot 0^2
= -2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad m^2 = -2
\]<p>For comparison, we restate the Higgs potential in the Standard Model:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4
\]<p>Here, the coefficient of the quadratic term (i.e., the mass term \( m^2 \)) is:</p>
\[
m^2 = -\mu^2
\]<p>Substituting the previously obtained result \( \mu^2 = 2 \), we obtain:</p>
\[
m^2 = -2
\]<p>Therefore, the mass terms in both models are identical.</p><p>Consequently, both the vacuum expectation value and the mass term derived from the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) in the present model exactly agree with those of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>(From the previously derived vacuum expectation value formula:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
R = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{246\,\mathrm{GeV}} \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}
\]<p>Using the natural unit conversion (\(\hbar = c = 1\)), \(1\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \approx 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
R \approx \left(5.75 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\right) \times \left(1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m/GeV}^{-1}\right)
\approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}
\]<p>This value matches the electroweak scale at which the Higgs boson was discovered in LHC experiments (\(\sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\)).)</p>
<h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2><p>In this paper, we derived the following scale-dependent effective cosmological term from the scalar field \(\phi(r)\), which can be regarded as a quasi-solution to the variational principle:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]<p>functions effectively in the following three aspects:</p>
<ol class="ol-spacing">
  <li><strong>Consistency with cosmology:</strong> The effective term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) reaches its maximum value at \(r = R\), where
  \[
  \Lambda_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{R^2}.
  \]
  By identifying this with the observed cosmological constant, we obtain \(R \sim 10^{26} \, \mathrm{m}\), which coincides with the scale of the visible universe.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproduction of galactic rotation curves:</strong> Using the repulsive term based on \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), we constructed the following composite formula for rotational velocity:
  \[
  v_{\text{total}}^2(r) = v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r).
  \]
  Numerical evaluation using a realistic mass density model and representative parameters confirmed that this structure successfully reproduces the observed flat rotation velocity profiles of galaxies.</li>
  <li><strong>Possibility of singularity avoidance:</strong> By deriving the condition under which the repulsive energy equals the mass-energy of the black hole, we obtained a critical radius \( r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{GM}{c^2} \) at which collapse becomes energetically forbidden. This indicates that singularities can be naturally avoided within the internal dynamics of the proposed model, without requiring any external cutoff.</li>
</ol>
<p>These results confirm that the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model provides a coherent and effective theoretical framework capable of consistently describing a wide range of gravitational phenomena—from cosmological scales to galactic structures and the interiors of black holes.</p><p>The contribution of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) manifests as a geometrical effect opposite in direction to conventional gravity, playing a key role in both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the observed flattening of galactic rotation curves.</p><p>Moreover, this geometric repulsive effect naturally prevents the formation of curvature singularities, appearing as an anti-gravitational response intrinsic to the structure of space itself.</p>
<p>The quantitative evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy, along with empirical validation against observational data, remains a central task for future theoretical development and experimental verification. As a first step in this direction, we have confirmed the consistency with the Higgs mechanism within the scalar potential framework.</p>

  <h2>Appendix: Interpretation of the Mathematical Structure (Multiverse Implication)</h2>
  <p>The mathematical structure presented in this paper can be interpreted as follows:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>In order to extend geodesics, space first responds repulsively and expands outward;</li>
  <li>This repulsive response causes the collapse of quantum fluctuations;</li>
  <li>The collapse-generated energy is locally released into space;</li>
  <li>This released energy is converted into mass (i.e., matter);</li>
  <li>As a result, gravity (i.e., attractive curvature of space) emerges.</li>
  </ol>
  <p style="font-size: smaller;">(Here, “collapse” refers to both the transition of fluctuations into a stable state and the collapse of quantum superpositions.)</p>
  <blockquote>In other words, in terms of causality, the expansion of space occurs first, and as a secondary (side-effect-like) consequence, mass is generated, leading to the emergence of gravity.</blockquote>
  <p>Furthermore, in this theory, all physical laws can be altered simply by changing the internal structure of \(\phi(r)\). That is, from the viewpoint of theoretical "cost-performance", this model shows extremely high compatibility with multiverse theory.</p>
  <p>If one wishes to support multiverse theory and construct a universe governed by different physical laws, it becomes mathematically feasible to generate such a universe simply by replacing the internal content of \(\phi(r)\).</p>
  <blockquote>Even a universe governed by an unusual \(\phi(r)\) that leads to an internally inconsistent or meaningless structure can still be constructed mathematically. (Whether or not it “makes sense” is left aside.)</blockquote>

  <h2>Appendix: Consistency with CCC and Aeon Transition Structure</h2>
  <p>Since the condition \(M c_0 = M c^2\) (\(E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}}\)) is satisfied at the critical radius, it follows that \(c_0 = c^2\) at that point. Consequently, singularities are prohibited by the principle of energy conservation and the speed-of-light limit.</p>
  <p>According to the singularity section’s formula \(c_0 = GM/r\), in the limit \(c_0 \to 0\), the collapse diverges as \(r \to \infty\), accompanied by the scalar field \(\phi(r) \to 0\).</p>
  <p>This limiting behavior implies that the entire universe is ultimately absorbed into a single black hole structure. Mathematically, this limit corresponds precisely to the aeon-to-aeon transition surface in Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC).</p>
  <p>In CCC, the universe transitions through successive aeons, and this collapse-repulsion structure agrees with the conformal matching between aeons.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, in this model, the critical limit \(r = R \to \infty\) leads to \(\phi(r) \to 0\) and \(\delta(r \approx R) \to 0\). However, if we consider that the small nonzero residual \(\delta(r \approx R) \ne 0\) leaves a trace in the structure of space, then:</p>
  <p>The next aeon does not begin in perfect symmetry. Rather, it starts as a slightly asymmetric aeon, subtly marked by the traces of the previous aeon.</p>

  <h2>Appendix: Generative Monism —<br> 「生成一元論」</h2>
  <p>This concept asserts that both the Higgs mechanism and Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) are independently derived from the same scalar-field-based potential \(V(\phi(r))\), each emerging from distinct physical principles.</p>
  <p>Despite their independent origins, these two frameworks are mathematically connected in a unique and explicit manner via the same scalar structure and its limiting behavior — a relationship that exemplifies the unifying idea of <strong>「生成一元論」 (Generative Monism)</strong>.</p>
  <p>Specifically, the limiting structure \(c_0 \to 0\), \(r \to \infty\), \(\phi(r) \to 0\), and \(\delta(r \approx R) \to 0\), forms the common mathematical foundation underlying both the conformal boundaries in CCC and the vacuum structure in the Higgs mechanism.</p>

<h3>fΛ and the Vacuum Expectation Value, Higgs Boson, Z Boson, and W Boson</h3>
<h4>1. The Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) as the Onset of Breaking (\(r=R=2\))</h4>
<p>The vacuum expectation value (VEV), <strong>\(v \approx 246\ \mathrm{GeV}\)</strong>, corresponds to a stable vacuum where spontaneous symmetry breaking has already occurred. Symmetry is preserved just before this point (higher energy region), and the breaking begins around \(v\). In a variational residual plot, <strong>\(r=R=2\)</strong> is the threshold (starting point) of breaking.</p>
<h4>2. The Higgs Boson Mass as the Peak of Breaking</h4>
<p>The Higgs boson mass, <strong>\(m_H\) (here, using natural units \(\hbar = c = 1\), denoted as \(E_H\)) \(\approx 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\)</strong>, represents the curvature of the Higgs field potential, i.e., its resistance to fluctuations. Physically, it is the most prominent excitable eigenmode in the broken vacuum—the <strong>peak of spontaneous symmetry breaking</strong>.</p>
<p>If this peak coincides with the peak position of the variational residual, the energy scale where the vacuum structure responds most strongly (\(\delta(r)\) maximum, extreme value condition breaking) aligns with the Higgs boson mass scale. Thus, the breaking peak in the residual plot and the peak of spontaneous symmetry breaking are expected to coincide.</p>
<h4>3. The Naturalness of This Expectation</h4>
<ul>
<li>The onset of breaking (VEV) and the peak (Higgs mass) follow a simple doubling-scale relation (\(2 \to 4\)) on dimensionless coordinates.</li>
<li>This corresponds to halving energy through inverse proportion mapping, consistent with \(246\ \mathrm{GeV} \to 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\).</li>
<li>The variational residual structure geometrically encodes this "onset \(\to\) peak" relation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Scaling Law and General Form</h4>
<p>From the relation \(v = \sqrt{2}/R\) derived here, there is an inverse proportionality between the Higgs VEV \(v\) and characteristic scale \(R\): \(v \propto 1/R\). We assume a similar inverse proportionality \(E \propto 1/R\) holds for any related energy scale \(E\), not just \(v\). Since \(r\) and \(R\) are both dimensionless and correspond to each other, this can be rewritten as:</p>
\[
E \propto \frac{1}{r}
\]<p>From this,</p>
\[
\frac{E_v}{E} = \frac{(r_v)^{-1}}{(r(E))^{-1}} = \frac{r(E)}{r_v}
\]<p>Thus, the general equation is:</p>
\[
r(E) = r_v \times \frac{E_v}{E}
\]
<h4>5. Individual Application and Numerical Calculation</h4>
<p>Adopting <strong>\(r_v = R = 2\)</strong> and <strong>\(E_v = 246\ \mathrm{GeV}\)</strong> as reference points, from \(E \propto 1/r\) (\(E = \kappa / r\)), the proportionality constant is \(\kappa = r_v \times E_v = 2 \times 246\ \mathrm{GeV} = 492\ \mathrm{GeV}\), Giving:</p>
\[
r(E) = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{E}
\]<p><strong>(For clarity)</strong> \(r(E) = r_v \times (E_v / E) = (r_v \times E_v)/E = 492\ \mathrm{GeV}/E\)</p>
<p>Calculating individual scales (natural units, <span>\(\hbar = c = 1\)</span>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Higgs Boson</strong> (\(E_H \approx 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_H = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{125\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 3.94
\]
</li>
<li>
<strong>Z Boson</strong> (\(E_Z \approx 91.2\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_Z = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{91.2\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 5.39
\]
</li>
<li>
<strong>W Boson</strong> (\(E_W \approx 80.4\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_W = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{80.4\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 6.12
\]
</li>
</ol>
<p>An overlay of these calculated values on the variational residual plot, zoomed in on the relevant section, is shown in the figure below (also see Fig. 1 for reference).</p>
<figure style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;">
<img src="https://misaki-kasai.github.io/paper/higgs_r_scale.PNG" style="width:100%; height:auto;" alt="Overlay on the variational residual plot">
</figure>
<p>The 125 GeV Higgs mass, symbolizing spontaneous symmetry breaking, corresponds to <strong>\(r \approx 3.94\)</strong> on the residual plot, which coincides with the position of the peak of the extreme value condition at <strong>\(r \approx 4.10\)</strong>. Z and W bosons lie to the right of this peak, with residuals \(\delta(r) \approx 0.5\), consistent with physical intuition. This provides a consistent connection and deeper meaning to the observed Higgs scale values.</p>
<div class="note"><p><strong>Note:</strong> \(r\) and \(R\) are dimensionless before output. The variational residual \(\delta(r)\) is also dimensionless, meaning \(r\) and \(R\) "borrow" units from observations for comparison. Thus, the residual plot is on dimensionless coordinates, invariant under physical scale changes (e.g., Higgs scale).</p></div>
</div>
  <span style="display: block; height: 0.5em;"></span>
  <p>Additionally, since this model assumes that \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) coincides with \(\Lambda\) at \(r = R\), if we interpret cosmological observations as occurring at \(r = R\), then the main observational phenomena previously explained by ΛCDM (roughly speaking, about 70–80%) can be absorbed directly into this theory.<br>Einstein's field equations also remain valid and usable in this framework.</p>
  <p>This indicates that the present theory naturally encompasses both general relativity and the ΛCDM model as limiting or embedded structures.</p>

  <p>In addition to these results, there remains room for further adjustment by adding or subtracting the gravitational term.</p>
  <p>The reason for using only the repulsive term is that the gravitational term requires specifying or tuning the average mass density \(\rho\) individually for each galaxy, which has been omitted in this analysis.</p>
  <p>These results should therefore be considered only as a reference.</p>

  <h2>Appendix: Derivation of the Characteristic Velocity Scale \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) from the Effective Energy of \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \)</h2>
  <p>Based on the results of <a href="#section-6">Section 6</a> and the vacuum energy density formula in the \( \Lambda \)CDM model, the characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \) can be derived as follows. At the characteristic scale \(r = R\), i.e., under the condition used to derive \(v_0\), we have \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}} = \Lambda\), and thus the effective energy density is given by:</p>
  \[
  \rho_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8\pi G} \approx 10^{-26}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}
  \]<p>Assuming a spherically symmetric region of radius \( R \approx 1000\,\mathrm{kpc} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{m} \), and noting that \( 10^{22}\,\mathrm{m} \ll 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m} \), we can treat \( \rho_\Lambda \) as approximately constant within this scale and compute the effective mass:</p>
  \[
  M_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \approx 10^{42}\,\mathrm{kg}
  \]<p>We now consider the kinetic energy that would correspond to the characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \). <strong>Here, the key idea is that we first substitute \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \), converting the effective mass \( M_\Lambda \) entirely into kinetic energy, and then assess what fraction of this energy, \( E \), is actually required. This is the true purpose of the derivation — hence the mathematical steps appear in reverse order.</strong></p>
  \[
  E = \frac{1}{2} M_\Lambda v_0^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2E}{M_\Lambda}} \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s}
  \]<p>Thus, the characteristic velocity \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) naturally emerges from the framework of the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model. The corresponding energy \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \) is consistent with observationally typical scales.</p>
  <p>The total vacuum energy is estimated as \( E_\Lambda = M_\Lambda c^2 \approx 10^{59}\,\mathrm{J} \), which is significantly larger than \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \), thereby maintaining energetic consistency.</p>
  <p>These results quantitatively support that the scale-dependent term \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \), derived from the scalar field, can function as a physically plausible effective repulsive cosmological term.</p>

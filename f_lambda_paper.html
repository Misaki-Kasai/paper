  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Structural Note on the Variational Section</h2>
  <p>This model intentionally adopts a quasi-solution \(\phi(r)\), rather than an exact solution. The reason is that an exact solution would eliminate the physical significance of the characteristic scale \(r = R\), thereby preventing the reproduction of the essential behavior: scale-responsive structure of space.</p><p>If an exact solution were enforced, the parameter \(r = R\) would likely be absorbed into coordinate redefinitions or symmetry-induced degeneracies. In such a case, \(R\) would lose its status as a physically anchored scale and instead become a redundant parameter, thereby obscuring any meaningful scale-dependent structure in the resulting dynamics.</p><p>Being a quasi-solution is not a weakness but the structural foundation of the model—it is the key to realizing scale-dependent spatial dynamics.</p><p>To verify the validity of this quasi-solution, we conducted a variational residual analysis. The results show that the deviation is well-controlled, localized, and physically meaningful. This behavior is also visually illustrated in Fig. 1.</p><p>Please do not mistake the use of a quasi-solution for a flaw or a compromise. It is not a shortcoming, but the core of the theory and the very foundation of its structure.</p><p>Importantly, the quasi-solution is not adopted for approximation, but for its structural role in deriving the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\).</p><p>It does not imply that the entire structure of the universe or the fundamental field equations themselves are quasi-solutions. The aim of this study is to examine whether a quasi-structural term like \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\) can function effectively within a universe that is otherwise governed by exact solutions.</p>
  <p>This quasi-solution structure has been optimized to provide a consistent description from the cosmological scale (\(\sim 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}\)) to the Higgs scale (\(\sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\)). See also the <a href="#appendix">Appendix</a> for numerical estimates related to the Higgs scale, as well as a discussion of the conservation laws within this theory.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2><p>In this study, we propose an extension of the Einstein field equations by introducing a repulsive gravity framework based on the scale-responsive geometric repulsion effect of space, derived from a scalar field. This effect is modeled as a logarithmic-type potential structure, from which a scale-dependent effective cosmological term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), is derived. The impact of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) depends on spatial scale, potentially redefining the structural properties of gravity especially at galactic scales and within black hole interiors. We demonstrate that two key observational and theoretical challenges—the flattening of galactic rotation curves in their outer regions and the avoidance of black hole singularities—can be addressed in a unified and quantitative manner through the common scalar-field-derived term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\).</p>
<h2>Overview of the Galactic Rotation Curve Problem and the Singularity Problem</h2><p>Recent astronomical observations have revealed that the rotational velocities of stars in the outer regions of galaxies significantly exceed the values predicted by gravitational theory (general relativity) combined with the observed amount of baryonic matter. This discrepancy is known as the <em>galactic rotation curve problem</em>. It has long been considered difficult to account for this phenomenon without invoking the existence of dark matter <span style="color: blue;">[Rubin, V. C., & Ford, W. K. (1980). <em>Rotation of the Andromeda Nebula from a Spectroscopic Survey of Emission Regions</em>. The Astrophysical Journal]; [Sofue, Y., & Rubin, V. (2001). <em>Rotation Curves of Spiral Galaxies</em>. Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics]</span>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, gravitational collapse inside black holes is known, in the classical framework, to lead to a singularity—i.e., a region of infinite curvature—in the limit \(r \to 0\). This phenomenon is considered to signal the breakdown or limitation of general relativity itself <span style="color: blue;">[Penrose, R. (1965). <em>Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities</em>. Physical Review Letters]</span>. The so-called <em>singularity problem</em> strongly suggests the necessity of quantum corrections or structural modifications within gravitational theory.</p>
<h2>Successes and Limitations of the \(\Lambda\)CDM Model</h2><p>The \(\Lambda\)CDM model, which serves as the standard framework in modern cosmology, has achieved remarkable success in explaining observational data such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and Type Ia supernovae with high precision <span style="color: blue;">[Planck Collaboration (2020). <em>Planck 2018 Results. VI. Cosmological Parameters</em>. Astronomy & Astrophysics]</span>. However, the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) is defined as a static and uniform quantity, without incorporating any spatial structure or scale dependence.</p><p>Moreover, although \(\Lambda\)CDM relies on invisible components such as dark matter and dark energy, the true nature of these entities remains unknown. They function as auxiliary terms in the theoretical framework, and there has been persistent criticism that they lack a solid basis for physical reality <span style="color: blue;">[Padmanabhan, T. (2003). <em>Cosmological Constant—The Weight of the Vacuum</em>. Physics Reports]</span>.</p>
<h2>Motivation: Constructing a Cosmological Framework with Repulsion as the Subject</h2>
<p>This study attempts to construct a gravitational theory in which <strong>repulsive response is the subject</strong>, in contrast to general relativity, which treats “gravity = attraction” as its primary perspective.</p><p>Specifically, we propose a framework that introduces an effective cosmological constant term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), derived from a scalar field, which acts as a scale-dependent repulsive potential. This enables a unified description of gravitational structures ranging from galactic scales to black hole singularity scales.</p><p>It should be noted that this study adopts the stance of preserving the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) in the Einstein field equations as a true constant. However, its effect manifests in a scale-dependent manner through a logarithmic-type potential, and is therefore reflected in the observable gravitational structure as \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\). In this way, the aim is to construct a gravitational theory that retains the philosophical foundation of the \(\Lambda\)CDM model while overcoming its structural limitations.</p>
<h2 id="section4">Structure of the Effective Term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) and Derivation from the Scalar Field Potential</h2><p>In this section, we demonstrate that the effective \(\Lambda\) term</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2}
\]<p>is structurally derived from a variational principle applied to a spherically symmetric and static scalar field.</p><p>Here, \(R\) is a characteristic scale of space and corresponds to the radial position at which the effective term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) reaches its maximum. It serves as a physically meaningful parameter in this framework.</p><p>The scalar field \(\phi\) considered in this study is rigorously defined based on a Lorentz-invariant Lagrangian density. In its general form, this Lagrangian is given by</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} g^{\mu\nu} \partial_\mu \phi \, \partial_\nu \phi - V(\phi),
\]<p>where \(V(\phi)\) is the scalar potential. However, restricting ourselves to a spherically symmetric and static configuration \(\phi = \phi(r)\), we simplify the Lagrangian to the form</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 - V(\phi).
\]<p>This reduction is justified as an effective theory based on the symmetry of the solution and does not imply a violation of the original Lorentz invariance of the full Lagrangian.</p><p>In this context, the isotropic structure of the corresponding energy-momentum tensor is given by:</p>
\[
T_{\mu\nu}^{(\phi)} = \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 + V(\phi) \right] g_{\mu\nu}.
\]<p>We now assume the following form for the effective cosmological term, which depends on spatial scale:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2}.
\]<p>A natural choice of scalar field that reproduces this structure is:</p>
\[
\phi(r) = \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2}.
\]<p>Using this expression for \(\phi(r)\), the corresponding potential \(V(\phi(r))\) expands as follows:</p>
\[
\phi(r)^2 = \left( \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2} \right)^2 = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]
\[
\begin{aligned}
V(\phi(r)) &= -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right) \\[1.0em]
           &= -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \left( 4 - \frac{4R^2 r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \right) \\[1.0em]
           &= -\frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} + \underbrace{\frac{4R^2 r^4}{(R^2 + r^2)^4}}_{\text{Second-order correction term}}
\end{aligned}
\]<p>Here, the second term serves as a correction that slightly modifies the primary structure of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), but the leading term clearly satisfies the relation:</p>
\[
\boxed{V(\phi(r)) \propto -\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)}.
\]<p>In particular, in the regime \(r \ll R\), the correction term is significantly smaller than the leading term. In the opposite limit \(r \gg R\), we observe the following asymptotic behaviors:</p>
\[
\frac{r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2} \approx \frac{1}{r^2}, \quad \frac{r^4}{(R^2 + r^2)^4} \approx \frac{1}{r^4},
\]<p>indicating that the contribution from the correction term decays rapidly.</p><p>Furthermore, even at the intermediate scale \(r = R\), we find:</p>
\[
\frac{4R^2}{(2R^2)^2} = \frac{1}{R^2}, \quad
\frac{4R^2 R^4}{(2R^2)^4} = \frac{1}{4R^2},
\]<p>showing that the correction term remains only one-fourth of the leading term.</p><p>Therefore, across all spatial scales, the leading term dominates, and it is demonstrated that \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) can be directly and naturally derived from the scalar field potential \(V(\phi)\).</p>
<h2>Variational Evaluation of the Scalar Field</h2><p>In this section, we evaluate whether the Lagrangian of the scalar field \(\phi(r)\), derived from the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\) constructed in <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, satisfies the extremum condition based on the variational principle (Euler–Lagrange equation). In particular, we expect that the extremum condition is locally violated around the spatial scale \(r = R\), and that this violation rapidly diminishes for \(r \gg R\).</p><p>Such behavior is naturally anticipated from the structure of the adopted \(\phi(r)\), and it also corresponds to the notion that cosmic acceleration may be closely related to a local violation of the extremum condition.</p><p>Note that the violation of the extremum condition discussed here does not directly imply a violation of the conservation law \(\nabla^\mu T_{\mu\nu} = 0\).</p>
<h3>Euler–Lagrange Equation and Variational Residual</h3><p>In <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, the following scalar field was adopted as a natural candidate for reproducing the spatial dependence of the effective cosmological constant, based on the structure of the scalar potential \( V(\phi) \):</p>
\[
\phi(r) = \frac{2r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>The corresponding potential takes the following form:</p>
\[
V(\phi) = -\frac{1}{4} \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
\]<p>Under the assumption of spherical symmetry, the Lagrangian density becomes:</p>
\[
\mathcal{L}_\phi = -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 - V(\phi)
= -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d\phi}{dr} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4} \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
\]<p>The Euler–Lagrange equation derived from this Lagrangian is:</p>
\[
\frac{d^2\phi}{dr^2} = R^2 \phi^3 - 2\phi
\]<p>Here, in order to evaluate how well the assumed scalar field \(\phi(r)\) satisfies the extremum condition, we conduct the analysis under the following boundary conditions:</p>
\[
\phi(0) = 0, \quad \phi'(0) = \frac{2}{R^2}
\]<p>with the characteristic scale \(R = 2\), which is chosen because it highlights the features of the scalar field structure and the behavior of the effective \(\Lambda\) term most clearly, while also ensuring clarity in the analytical results and numerical plots.</p><p>Under these conditions, the deviation from the extremum condition (the variational residual) is defined as follows:</p>
\[
\delta(r) \equiv \frac{d^2\phi}{dr^2} - \left( R^2 \phi^3 - 2\phi \right)
\]<p>By substituting the assumed scalar field \(\phi(r)\) into this expression, the variational residual is explicitly given by:</p>
\[
\delta(r) = \left[\frac{4r(r^2 - 3R^2)}{(R^2 + r^2)^3}\right]
-
\left[\frac{8R^2 r^3}{(R^2 + r^2)^3} - \frac{4r}{R^2 + r^2}\right]
\]<p>Based on this expression, the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) for the scalar field \(\phi(r)\) was numerically evaluated. The resulting plots, including a close-up view, are shown in Fig. 1.</p>

       style="width:100%; height:auto;">
  <figcaption>Fig. 1: Variational residual \(\delta(r)\) for the adopted scalar field \(\phi(r)\).</figcaption>
</figure><p>From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) begins to locally deviate at the spatial scale \(r = R\), reaches a peak shortly thereafter (\( r &gt; R \)), and then rapidly decays. This result indicates that the scalar field specifically recognizes and responds to \(r = R\), and that the violation of the extremum condition is local and non-instantaneous. Such behavior is also consistent with the nature of the sustained cosmic acceleration.</p><p>The range of analysis is set to \( r \in [0.0001, 100] \). Within this interval, the maximum value of the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) is found to be:</p>
\[
\delta_{\text{max}} \approx 0.552 \quad \text{at} \quad r \approx 4.10 \approx R
\]<p>To evaluate the significance of this residual, we define the relative error with respect to the extremum condition as:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi(r) \equiv \left| \frac{\delta(r)}{\phi(r)} \right|
\]<p>At the point where the residual peaks (\(r \approx 4.10\)), the scalar field takes the value \(\phi(r) \approx 0.394\), yielding:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi \approx 1.40
\]<p>Similarly, at the characteristic scale \(r = R = 2.00\), the relative error is:</p>
\[
\epsilon_\phi(R) = \left| \frac{\delta(R)}{\phi(R)} \right| = 0.750 \quad (\delta(R) = 0.375,\ \phi(R) = 0.500)
\]<p>Even around the characteristic scale \( r = R \), the relative error remains within a range that can be regarded as a local violation of the extremum condition.</p>
<p>The value \( \epsilon_\phi(R) = 0.750 \) supports the validity of the function as a quasi-solution.</p><p>On the other hand, the variational residual \( \delta(r) \) reaches its maximum around \( r \approx 4.10 \), where the relative error rises to approximately \( \epsilon_\phi \approx 1.40 \).</p>
<p>However, since \( \phi(r) \) becomes small at this scale, the relative error is numerically overestimated due to the small denominator.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is more appropriate to evaluate the validity of the quasi-solution primarily around \( r = R \).</p><p>Based on these considerations, the scalar field \( \phi(r) \) adopted in this study, while not an exact solution, can be regarded as a physically acceptable quasi-solution that does not significantly violate the variational principle.</p>
<p>In this paper, we refer to the structure based on the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\), constructed from the quasi-solution \(\phi(r)\), as the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model (or the fΛ theory).</p>
<h2 id="section6">Consistency Between the Maximum of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) and the Observed Cosmological Constant \(\Lambda\)</h2>
<p>The derived scale-dependent effective cosmological term,</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]<p>attains its maximum at \(r = R\), with the value given by</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}} = \left. \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \right|_{r=R} 
= \frac{4R^2}{(R^2 + R^2)^2} 
= \frac{4R^2}{4R^4} 
= \frac{1}{R^2}.
\]<p>If this maximum is identified with the observed cosmological constant,</p>
\[
\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}\,\text{m}^{-2},
\]<p>then it follows that</p>
\[
R = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} \approx 10^{26}\,\text{m},
\]<p>which coincides with the current observational scale of the visible universe (approximately \(10^{26}\) meters, or about 10 billion light-years).</p><p>This result implies that the effective cosmological term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), derived from the scalar field structure proposed in this study, is naturally consistent with the observed value of the cosmological constant. It supports the interpretation of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) as a physically viable candidate for the origin of cosmic repulsion.</p>
<h2 id="section7">Implications and the Extended Einstein Field Equations</h2>
<p>The modified Einstein field equation corresponding to this effective energy density is written as:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) g_{\mu\nu} + G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})},
\]
or, equivalently, with \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) moved to the right-hand side:
\[
G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa T_{\mu\nu}^{(\text{matter})} - \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) g_{\mu\nu}.
\]<p>At local scales, such as within the solar system, the following condition holds:</p>
\[
\frac{\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)}{\kappa T_{\mu\nu}} \ll 1,
\]<p>which naturally reduces the modified equation to the standard Einstein field equation.</p><p>Therefore, the theory remains consistent with well-established observations that are precisely explained by general relativity, such as the perihelion precession of Mercury and the gravitational redshift.</p>
<h2>Application to Galactic Rotation Curves and the Effective Energy of the \(\Lambda\) Term</h2>
<h3>(1) Gravitational Term: Realistic Approximation Model (Spherically Symmetric Uniform Density)</h3><p>In the central region of a galaxy, the baryonic matter is relatively concentrated, allowing the use of a spherically symmetric and uniform density approximation. Under this assumption, the mass \(M(r)\) enclosed within a radius \(r\) is given by:</p>
\[
\rho = \text{const} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \rho.
\]<p>From the gravitational potential generated by this mass distribution, the rotational velocity is derived as:</p>
\[
v_{\text{grav}}(r) = \sqrt{\frac{G M(r)}{r}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3} \pi G \rho} \cdot r
\quad \Rightarrow \quad v_{\text{grav}}(r) \propto r.
\]<p>This result is consistent with the linear increase in rotational velocity observed in the inner regions of galactic rotation curves. Indeed, observations show that near the galactic center, the rotational velocity tends to follow \(v \propto r\), making this model a good approximation in the gravity-dominated region of the galactic core.</p>
<h3>(2) Repulsive Term: Rotational Velocity from the \(\Lambda\) Term and logarithmic-type Extension</h3><p>While the gravitational term from the uniform density model dominates in the central region of galaxies, explaining the flattened rotation curves in the outer regions requires a different dynamical contribution.</p><p>In the present model, we assume that a scale-dependent effective \(\Lambda\) term, derived from a scalar field associated with a logarithmic-type potential, produces a repulsive effect on space. This effect contributes to the squared rotational velocity in the following form:</p>
\[
v_{\text{rep}}^2(r) = v_0^2 \cdot \frac{2r^2}{R^2 + r^2},
\]<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(v_0\) is a characteristic velocity scale associated with the repulsive term,</li>
  <li>which becomes dominant in the outer galactic region (\(r \gg R\)).</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on observational data, we adopt a representative value of \(v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s}\). Since this function contributes negligibly near the center and asymptotically approaches a constant value \(v_{\mathrm{rep}} \to \sqrt{2}\,v_0\) as \(r \to \infty\), it naturally reproduces the observed flattening of galactic rotation curves.</p>
<h3>(3) Rotational Velocity from Energy Composition</h3>
<p>In this model, the gravitational and repulsive contributions to the rotational velocity are regarded as independent energy components. Therefore, the observed rotational velocity is expressed as a quadratic energy sum:</p>
\[
\begin{aligned} v_{\text{total}}^{2}(r) &= v_{\text{grav}}^{2}(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^{2}(r) \\[0.5em] &\Downarrow \\[0.5em] v_{\text{total}}(r) &= \sqrt{v_{\text{grav}}^{2}(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^{2}(r)} \end{aligned}
\]<p>This composite structure implies that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the inner region, \(v_{\text{grav}} \propto r\) dominates,</li>
  <li>While in the outer region, \(v_{\text{rep}} \to v_0\) flattens the rotation curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>This framework demonstrates that the essential features of galactic rotation curves can be reproduced without assuming the existence of dark matter, thereby supporting the validity of the effective \(\Lambda\) term, \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\).</p>
<h3>(4) Deriving the Velocity v₀ ≈ 200 km/s from the Effective Energy of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r)\)</h3><p>The characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \) can be derived from the result of <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> and the energy density of space in the \( \Lambda \)CDM model, which is given by</p>
\[
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8\pi G} \approx 10^{-26} \, \text{kg/m}^3.
\]<p>By integrating this density over a spherically symmetric region of radius \( R \approx 1000\,\text{kpc} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{22}\,\text{m} \), we obtain the effective mass:
\[
M_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \approx 10^{42} \, \text{kg}.
\]<p>If we convert the entire energy associated with this mass into kinetic energy, the result is:</p>
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} M_\Lambda v_0^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2E}{M_\Lambda}} \approx 200\,\text{km/s}.
\]<p>Therefore, the characteristic velocity \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) is naturally derived within the framework of the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model, and the corresponding energy \( E \) is consistent with the typical observational energy scale \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \). Considering that the total vacuum energy is given by \( E_\Lambda = M_\Lambda c^2 \approx 10^{59}\,\mathrm{J} \), the energy scale \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \) is sufficiently small in comparison, ensuring energetic consistency. These results quantitatively support the physical plausibility of the scale-dependent term \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \), derived from the scalar field, as an effective cosmological repulsive component.</p>
<h3>(5) Physical Interpretation: Dominant Structures by Region</h3>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li><strong>Central region</strong> (\( r &lt; R \)): The gravitational term dominates, with \(v_{\text{grav}} \propto r\).</li>
  <li><strong>Intermediate region</strong> (\(r \approx R\)): The repulsive term \(v_{\text{rep}}\) becomes dominant, flattening the rotation velocity.</li>
  <li><strong>Outer region</strong> (\( r &gt; R \)): The rotation velocity slowly decays or rises again, reflecting the logarithmic-type structure and scale dependence of \(\Lambda\).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Representative Parameters and Plotting Conditions</strong></p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>Gravitational constant: \(G = 4.302 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{kpc \cdot (km/s)^2 / M_\odot}\)</li>
  <li>Mass density (average over the galaxy): \(\rho = 10^6 \, M_\odot/\mathrm{kpc^3}\)</li>
  <li>Scale parameter: \(R = 5 \, \mathrm{kpc}\)</li>
  <li>Repulsive velocity scale: \(v_0 = 200 \, \mathrm{km/s}\)</li>
  <li>Radial range for calculation: \(r = 0.1 \sim 20 \, \mathrm{kpc}\)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the above representative values, the numerically plotted rotation velocity profile at the galactic scale is shown in Fig. 2, based on the previously derived composite formula:</p>
\[
v_{\text{total}}(r) = \sqrt{v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r)}.
\]

  <figcaption>Fig. 2: Numerical simulation of gravitational, repulsive, and total rotational velocity components for a galactic rotation curve.</figcaption>
</figure><p>As clearly demonstrated by the numerical simulation results shown in Fig. 2, it was initially expected that the gravitational term would dominate in the central region \( r &lt; R \). However, the repulsive component was quantitatively found to exceed the gravitational component across all spatial scales. This indicates that the rotational velocity within galaxies is effectively governed by the scalar-field-induced effective \(\Lambda\) term, characterized by its logarithmic-type structure.</p><p>This result not only explains the observed flattening of rotational velocities in the outer regions of galaxies, but also reveals that the repulsive term significantly contributes even in the central region. It strongly supports the possibility that the scale-dominant behavior of the logarithmic-type repulsive term extends far more broadly than previously anticipated.</p>
<h2 id="section9">Avoidance Conditions for Black Hole Singularities</h2>
<p>As a scale-dependent repulsive force derived from the quasi-solution scalar field \(\phi(r)\), we introduce the following acceleration term:</p>
\[
a(r) = \frac{2c_0 r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>Here, \(c_0\) is a repulsive potential coefficient (unit: \(\mathrm{m^2/s^2}\)), representing the spatial energy scale of the repulsive field.</p>
<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> Inside the black hole, the repulsive acceleration acts spherically symmetrically and is assumed to balance the gravitational acceleration just before the singularity is reached.</p><p><strong>Balance Condition Between Repulsive and Gravitational Forces:</strong> Under this assumption, the balance condition is expressed as:</p>
\[
\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{2c_0 r}{R^2 + r^2}
\]<p>where \(M\) denotes the mass of the black hole.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Condition:</strong> By adopting \(R = r\) as the characteristic scale, the balance condition simplifies to:<br>(The reason for adopting \( r = R \) (\( R = r \)) is that the function \(a(r)\) reaches its maximum at \( r = R \).)</p>
\[
\frac{GM}{r^2} = \frac{c_0}{r} \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_0 = \frac{GM}{r}
\]<p><strong>Critical Condition for Singularity Avoidance:</strong> We define the critical radius \(r_{\text{crit}}\) at which the repulsive energy equals the total mass-energy of the black hole.</p><p>The repulsive energy is given by:</p>
\[
E_{\text{rep}} = M \cdot c_0 = \frac{GM^2}{r}
\]<p>The mass-energy of the black hole is:</p>
\[
E_{\text{BH}} = M c^2
\]<p>This model assumes that the repulsive response of space is induced by the black hole’s own mass-energy. Thus, the model can be treated as a closed system.</p>
<p>Under this assumption, the principle of energy conservation implies that the repulsive energy accumulated within the black hole cannot exceed the total mass-energy of the black hole.</p>
<p>Therefore, setting the two energies equal yields the critical radius at which collapse becomes energetically impossible:</p>
\[
E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{GM^2}{r_{\text{crit}}} = M c^2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{GM}{c^2}
\]<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> This result implies that the collapse of a black hole naturally halts at a finite scale, which is determined solely by the mass \(M\), gravitational constant \(G\), and the speed of light \(c\).</p><p>This critical radius exactly corresponds to half the Schwarzschild radius:</p>
\[
r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{1}{2} r_s, \quad \text{where} \quad r_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
\]<p>Thus, the singularity is autonomously avoided not by an external cutoff, but by the internal repulsive structure of space itself within the theory.</p>
<p>(Since the condition \(M c_0 = M c^2\) (\(E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}}\)) is satisfied at the critical radius, it follows that \(c_0 = c^2\) at that point. Consequently, singularities are prohibited by the principle of energy conservation and the speed-of-light limit.)</p>
<h2 id="section10">Consistency with the Higgs Mechanism</h2><p>In this section, we show that the vacuum expectation value and mass term derived from the potential</p>
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right)
= -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4
\]<p>defined in <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, match those of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model.</p><p>In the Standard Model, the effective potential for the Higgs mechanism is given by:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4
\]<p>The vacuum expectation value \( v \) in this structure is determined by the extremum condition:</p>
\[
\left. \frac{dV}{d\phi} \right|_{\phi = v} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v = \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}}
\]
<h3>Vacuum Expectation Value</h3><p>Differentiating the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) in the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model yields:</p>
\[
\frac{dV}{d\phi} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \phi(-2 + R^2 \phi^2) = 0
\]<p>Therefore, the solutions are:</p>
\[
\phi = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \phi = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Thus, excluding the trivial solution \( \phi = 0 \), the vacuum expectation value in the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model is:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}, \quad \phi = \pm v
\]<p>Now, in order to demonstrate the consistency, we compare the coefficients of the quadratic and quartic terms between \( V(\phi(r)) \) and \( V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) \), and obtain:</p>
\[
-\phi^2 \leftrightarrow -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mu^2 = 2
\]
\[
\frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4 \leftrightarrow \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = R^2
\]<p>Therefore, the position of the minimum in the Standard Model is:</p>
\[
\phi = \pm \sqrt{\frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{R^2}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Thus, the vacuum expectation value is:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\]<p>Hence, the vacuum expectation value \( v \) is identical in both models.</p>
<h3>Mass Term</h3><p>For convenience, we restate the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) introduced earlier:</p>
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\frac{1}{4} \cdot \phi^2 \left( 4 - R^2 \phi^2 \right) = -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4
\]<p>To extract the physical mass term \( m^2 \), we compute the second derivative of the potential and evaluate it at \( \phi = 0 \):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: First derivative</strong></p>
\[
\frac{dV}{d\phi}
= \frac{d}{d\phi} \left( -\phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4 \right)
= -2\phi + R^2 \phi^3
\]<p><strong>Step 2: Second derivative</strong></p>
\[
\frac{d^2 V}{d\phi^2}
= \frac{d}{d\phi} \left( -2\phi + R^2 \phi^3 \right)
= -2 + 3R^2 \phi^2
\]<p><strong>Step 3: Evaluation at \( \phi = 0 \)</strong></p>
\[
\left. \frac{d^2 V}{d\phi^2} \right|_{\phi = 0}
= -2 + 3R^2 \cdot 0^2
= -2
\quad \Rightarrow \quad m^2 = -2
\]<p>For comparison, we restate the Higgs potential in the Standard Model:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\frac{1}{2} \mu^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda \phi^4
\]<p>Here, the coefficient of the quadratic term (i.e., the mass term \( m^2 \)) is:</p>
\[
m^2 = -\mu^2
\]<p>Substituting the previously obtained result \( \mu^2 = 2 \), we obtain:</p>
\[
m^2 = -2
\]<p>Therefore, the mass terms in both models are identical.</p><p>Consequently, both the vacuum expectation value and the mass term derived from the potential \( V(\phi(r)) \) in the present model exactly agree with those of the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>(From the previously derived vacuum expectation value formula:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
R = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{246\,\mathrm{GeV}} \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}
\]<p>Using the natural unit conversion (\(\hbar = c = 1\)), \(\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \approx 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
R \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3} \times 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m} \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}
\]<p>This value matches the electroweak scale at which the Higgs boson was discovered in LHC experiments (\(\sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\)).)</p>
<h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2><p>In this paper, we derived the following scale-dependent effective cosmological term from the scalar field \(\phi(r)\), which can be regarded as a quasi-solution to the variational principle:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) = \frac{4r^2}{(R^2 + r^2)^2},
\]<p>functions effectively in the following three aspects:</p>
<ol class="ol-spacing">
  <li><strong>Consistency with cosmology:</strong> The effective term \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) reaches its maximum value at \(r = R\), where
  \[
  \Lambda_{\text{eff}}^{\text{max}} = \frac{1}{R^2}.
  \]
  By identifying this with the observed cosmological constant, we obtain \(R \sim 10^{26} \, \mathrm{m}\), which coincides with the scale of the visible universe.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproduction of galactic rotation curves:</strong> Using the repulsive term based on \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\), we constructed the following composite formula for rotational velocity:
  \[
  v_{\text{total}}^2(r) = v_{\text{grav}}^2(r) + v_{\text{rep}}^2(r).
  \]
  Numerical evaluation using a realistic mass density model and representative parameters confirmed that this structure successfully reproduces the observed flat rotation velocity profiles of galaxies.</li>
  <li><strong>Possibility of singularity avoidance:</strong> By deriving the condition under which the repulsive energy equals the mass-energy of the black hole, we obtained a critical radius \( r_{\text{crit}} = \frac{GM}{c^2} \) at which collapse becomes energetically forbidden. This indicates that singularities can be naturally avoided within the internal dynamics of the proposed model, without requiring any external cutoff.</li>
</ol>
<p>These results confirm that the \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) model provides a coherent and effective theoretical framework capable of consistently describing a wide range of gravitational phenomena—from cosmological scales to galactic structures and the interiors of black holes.</p><p>The contribution of \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}}\) manifests as a geometrical effect opposite in direction to conventional gravity, playing a key role in both the accelerated expansion of the universe and the observed flattening of galactic rotation curves.</p><p>Moreover, this geometric repulsive effect naturally prevents the formation of curvature singularities, appearing as an anti-gravitational response intrinsic to the structure of space itself.</p>
<p>The quantitative evaluation of the model's predictive accuracy, along with empirical validation against observational data, remains a central task for future theoretical development and experimental verification. As a first step in this direction, we have confirmed the consistency with the Higgs mechanism within the scalar potential framework.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Conservation Laws and the Friedmann Equation</h2>
<p>The extended Einstein equation defined in <a href="#section7">Section 7</a> is:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\, g_{\mu\nu} + G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\,T^{(\mathrm{matter})}_{\mu\nu}, \qquad \kappa \equiv \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}.
\]<p>Because this theory explicitly incorporates the spatial dependence of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\) into the Einstein equation, it becomes possible to discuss local and global conservation laws in a unified framework.</p>
<h3>Universal Functional Form of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\)</h3>
<p>Rewriting the effective \(\Lambda\) term derived in <a href="#section4">Section 4</a>, \(\displaystyle \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) = \dfrac{4r^{2}}{(R^{2}+r^{2})^{2}}\), we have:</p>
\[
\boxed{\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)=\frac{1}{R^{2}}F\!\left(\frac{r}{R}\right), \quad F(x)=\frac{4x^{2}}{(1+x^{2})^{2}}, \quad x \equiv \frac{r}{R}}
\]<p>Substituting \(F(x)\) and expanding \(x\), we recover the original form:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r) = \frac{4 r^{2}}{\left(R^{2} + r^{2}\right)^{2}}
\]<p>Thus, by introducing \(\dfrac{r}{R} = x\), it becomes clear that \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\) can be expressed in terms of a universal, scale-independent function \(F(x)\).</p>
<h3>Bianchi Identity and the Definition of the Exchange Current \(J_\nu\)</h3>
<p>Applying \(\nabla^\mu\) to the extended Einstein equation, we use the Bianchi identity \(\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu}=0\) and the property \(\nabla^\mu g_{\mu\nu}=0\). Since \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is a scalar quantity, it also satisfies \(\nabla_\nu\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}} = \partial_\nu\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\). Using these relations, we obtain:</p>
\[
\kappa\,\nabla^\mu T^{(\mathrm{m})}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_\nu \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}.
\]<p>To describe the local non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor (hereafter referred to as the matter term) alone, we define the exchange current \(J_\nu\) as follows:</p>
\[
\boxed{J_\nu \equiv \nabla^\mu T^{(\mathrm{m})}_{\mu\nu} = \frac{1}{\kappa}\,\partial_\nu \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}
\]<p>This equation implies that whenever there is a spacetime gradient in \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\), an exchange of energy and momentum occurs between the matter component and the vacuum energy. In other words, the matter term by itself satisfies \(J_\nu \neq 0\), meaning local conservation is violated; however, as discussed later, global conservation is still maintained when the vacuum contribution is included in the total system.</p>
<h3>Exchange Current in a Static, Spherically Symmetric Field</h3>
<p>In a static and spherically symmetric field, the dependence on time and angular coordinates disappears, leaving only the radial component of the exchange current:</p>
\[
\boxed{J_r = \frac{1}{\kappa}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\mathrm{d}r}}
\]<p>As mentioned earlier, \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\) is given by:</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)=\frac{1}{R^2}F\!\left(\frac{r}{R}\right),\quad F(x)=\frac{4x^2}{(1+x^2)^2},\quad x=\frac{r}{R}
\]<p>Therefore, using the chain rule, we have:</p>
\[
\frac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr} = \frac{d}{dr}\!\left[\frac{1}{R^{2}}F\!\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)\right] = \frac{1}{R^{2}}\!\cdot\!\frac{dF}{dx}\!\cdot\!\frac{dx}{dr} = \frac{1}{R^{2}}\!\cdot\!\frac{dF}{dx}\!\cdot\!\frac1R
\]<p>Thus, the derivative becomes:</p>
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\mathrm{d}r}=\dfrac{1}{R^3}\dfrac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}, \quad \dfrac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}=\dfrac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}}
\]<p>Accordingly, the exchange current can be expressed as:</p>
\[
\boxed{J_r=\frac{1}{\kappa R^3}\frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}}
\]<p>Substituting the explicit expression for \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
J_r=\frac{1}{\kappa R^3}\frac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3},\qquad x=\frac{r}{R}
\]
<h3>Definition of the Normalized Exchange Current \(\tilde J\) and Analysis of Its Extrema</h3>
<p>To normalize the exchange current \(J_r\), we define:</p>
\[
\boxed{\tilde J(x)\equiv\kappa R^3J_r=\frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}}
\]<p>\(\tilde J\) is a universal function independent of the scale \(R\) and exhibits the following sign structure:</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li><span>\(x \lt 1 \Rightarrow \tilde J \gt 0\)</span>: Energy flows from the vacuum into matter.</li>
  <li><span>\(x \gt 1 \Rightarrow \tilde J \lt 0\)</span>: Energy is transferred back from matter to the vacuum.</li>
  <li><span>\(x = 1\)</span>, where <span>\(\tilde J = 0\)</span>: The transition point between energy supply and recovery.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary:</p>
<div style="border:3px solid currentColor; padding:1em; text-align:center; border-radius:6px; line-height:2;">
  <span>\(\text{For }\, r \lt R\;\)</span><strong> energy flows from vacuum to matter</strong><br>
  \(\Updownarrow\)<br>
  <span>\(\text{At }\, r = R\;\)</span><strong> the flow reverses</strong><br>
  \(\Updownarrow\)<br>
  <span>\(\text{For }\, r \gt R\;\)</span><strong> energy flows from matter back to vacuum</strong>
</div>
<h4>Deriving the Peaks of Energy Supply and Recovery</h4>
<p>The peaks are determined from the extrema of \(\tilde J(x)\). Rewriting the first derivative for reference:</p>
\[
\tilde J(x) = \frac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}x} = \frac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}
\]<p>Therefore, the second derivative is given by:</p>
\[
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2F}{\mathrm{d}x^2} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}x}\left[\frac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}\right] = \frac{8(3x^4 - 8x^2 + 1)}{(1+x^2)^4}
\]<p>From the extremum condition \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2F}{\mathrm{d}x^2}=0\), we obtain:</p>
\[
\boxed{3x^4-8x^2+1=0},\qquad x=\frac{r}{R},\ r \ge 0,\ R > 0.
\]<p>Introducing the substitution \(x^2 = y\), we solve for \(y\):</p>
\[
y=\frac{4\pm\sqrt{13}}{3},\qquad x_{\pm}=\sqrt{\frac{4\pm\sqrt{13}}{3}}
\]<p>Since \(r \ge 0\) and \(R &gt; 0\), we have \(x = \dfrac{r}{R} \ge 0\), so the solutions are:</p>
\[
\boxed{x = \sqrt{\dfrac{4 \pm \sqrt{13}}{3}}}
\]
<h4>Numerical Evaluation of Extrema and Peak Values</h4>
<p>From the previous solutions, the locations of the extrema are numerically evaluated as follows:</p>
\[
x_{\mathrm{sup}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{4 - \sqrt{13}}{3}} \approx 0.363,\quad x_{\mathrm{rec}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{4 + \sqrt{13}}{3}} \approx 1.592
\]<p>Substituting these into \(\tilde J(x)=\dfrac{8x(1-x^2)}{(1+x^2)^3}\), the values of the supply and recovery peaks are obtained as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Supply Peak (positive)</b>:
  <div>
  \[
  \tilde J(x_{\mathrm{sup}})=\frac{8\,x_{\mathrm{sup}}\!\left(1-x_{\mathrm{sup}}^2\right)}{\left(1+x_{\mathrm{sup}}^2\right)^3}\approx\boxed{+\,1.739}
  \]
  </div>
  </li>
  <li><b>Recovery Peak (negative)</b>:
  <div>
  \[
  \tilde J(x_{\mathrm{rec}})=\frac{8\,x_{\mathrm{rec}}\!\left(1-x_{\mathrm{rec}}^2\right)}{\left(1+x_{\mathrm{rec}}^2\right)^3}\approx\boxed{-\,0.443}
  \]
  </div>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the maximum energy supply from the vacuum to matter occurs around \(x \approx 0.36\) with a magnitude of \(\tilde J \approx +1.74\). Similarly, the maximum energy recovery from matter back into the vacuum takes place near \(x \approx 1.59\) with a magnitude of \(\tilde J \approx -0.44\).</p>
<h4>Determining the Nature of the Extrema</h4>
<p>The nature of each extremum (whether it corresponds to a maximum or a minimum) can be determined using the sign of \(\tilde J(x)\) as follows:</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>Since \(x_{\mathrm{sup}} \approx 0.363 &lt; 1\), we have \(1 - x_{\mathrm{sup}}^2 &gt; 0\), which gives \(\tilde J(x_{\mathrm{sup}}) &gt; 0\). Therefore, \(x_{\mathrm{sup}}\) corresponds to the <strong>supply peak</strong> (local maximum).</li>
  <li>Since \(x_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1.592 &gt; 1\), we have \(1 - x_{\mathrm{rec}}^2 &lt; 0\), which gives \(\tilde J(x_{\mathrm{rec}}) &lt; 0\). Therefore, \(x_{\mathrm{rec}}\) corresponds to the <strong>recovery peak</strong> (local minimum).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, since the second derivative \(\dfrac{\mathrm{d}^2F}{\mathrm{d}x^2}\) changes sign across the equation \(3x^4 - 8x^2 + 1 = 0\), this classification of the extrema as maxima and minima is confirmed.</p>
<h3>Global Conservation Law</h3>
<p>Integrating the exchange current \(J_r\) along the radial direction yields:</p>
\[
\int_{0}^{\infty}J_r\,\mathrm{d}r=\frac{1}{\kappa}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\mathrm{d}\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\mathrm{d}r}\,\mathrm{d}r=\frac{1}{\kappa}\big[\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(\infty)-\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(0)\big]=0
\]<p>Substituting explicitly \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)=\dfrac{4r^2}{(R^2+r^2)^2}\) gives the same result:</p>
\[
\boxed{\displaystyle \frac{1}{\kappa}\int_{0}^{\infty}\!\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\!\left(\frac{4r^2}{(R^2+r^2)^2}\right)\right]\mathrm{d}r=0}
\]<p>Thus, because the endpoints satisfy \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(0)=\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(\infty)=0\), the local energy supply and recovery along the radial direction exactly cancel out, ensuring strict global conservation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the surface integral under spherical symmetry, that is, the total flux of \(J_r\), is given by:</p>
\[
\Phi(r)=\oint_{S_r}J^i\,\mathrm{d}\Sigma_i=4\pi r^2 J_r
\]<p>As noted earlier, since \(J_r=\dfrac{1}{\kappa}\,\dfrac{\mathrm{d}\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\mathrm{d}r}\), we have:</p>
\[
J_r=\frac{1}{\kappa}\,\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}r}\!\left[\frac{4r^2}{(R^2+r^2)^2}\right]=\frac{1}{\kappa}\,\frac{8r\,(R^2-r^2)}{(R^2+r^2)^3}
\]<p>Therefore, the total flux becomes:</p>
\[
\Phi(r)=4\pi r^2 J_r=\frac{32\pi}{\kappa}\,\frac{r^3(R^2-r^2)}{(R^2+r^2)^3}
\]<p>Taking the limits at the endpoints gives:</p>
\[
\Phi(0)=\lim_{r\to0}\left(\frac{32\pi}{\kappa}\,\frac{r^3(R^2-r^2)}{(R^2+r^2)^3}\;\Rightarrow\;\frac{r^3R^2}{(R^2)^3}=\frac{r^3}{R^4}\right)=0,
\]
\[
\Phi(\infty)=\lim_{r\to\infty}\left(\frac{32\pi}{\kappa}\,\frac{r^3(R^2-r^2)}{(R^2+r^2)^3}\;\Rightarrow\;\frac{-r^5}{(r^2)^3}=-\frac{1}{r}\right)=0.
\]<p>Thus, since \(\Phi(0)=\Phi(\infty)=0\), the total energy supplied from the vacuum and recovered back into it is exactly balanced over the entire volume of space.<br>Consequently, a <strong>global energy conservation law, which is difficult to define in general relativity, is established here</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scale Dependence of the Exchange Current</h3>
<p>The magnitude of the exchange current \(J_r\) is given by:</p>
\[
\boxed{|J_r| \sim \frac{1}{\kappa R^3} \, |\tilde J(x)|}
\]<p>This expression shows that the larger the characteristic scale \(R\), the more strongly the exchange current is suppressed.</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>Cosmological scale: \(R_{\mathrm{cosmo}} \sim 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}\) → \(|J_r|\) becomes extremely small, and any apparent local violation of conservation is observationally negligible.</li>
  <li>Higgs scale: \(R_{\mathrm{Higgs}} \sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\) → \(|J_r|\) becomes very large, and local exchange currents become significant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the magnitude of the exchange current scales as \(|J_r| \sim \dfrac{1}{\kappa R^3}\), the ratio of the exchange strength between the Higgs scale and the cosmological scale is given by:</p>
\[
\frac{|J_r|_{\mathrm{Higgs}}}{|J_r|_{\mathrm{cosmo}}} = \left(\frac{R_{\mathrm{cosmo}}}{R_{\mathrm{Higgs}}}\right)^3 \sim \left(\frac{10^{26}}{10^{-18}}\right)^3 \sim 10^{132}
\]<p>This implies that, at the Higgs scale, the exchange current is about \(10^{132}\) times stronger than at the cosmological scale.</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li><strong>Local regime</strong>: Since \(\nabla^\mu T^{(\mathrm{m})}_{\mu\nu}=J_\nu\neq0\), energy exchange occurs between vacuum and matter. This effect is particularly significant at the Higgs scale, whereas on cosmological scales the exchange current is nearly zero. Because \(\int_0^\infty J_r\,\mathrm{d}r=0\), the radial exchange currents locally cancel out at each characteristic scale.</li>
  <li><strong>Global regime</strong>: Since \(\Phi(0)=\Phi(\infty)=0\), the energy supplied and recovered are perfectly balanced across the entire space, and the global energy conservation law holds exactly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, not only is energy conserved globally, but local conservation is effectively restored as well. Although local violations of conservation are extremely difficult to detect directly, traces of the exchange current can manifest at the Higgs scale in the form of mass generation. On the other hand, at cosmological scales, the exchange current is so small that both the violation of conservation and any associated traces are practically undetectable.</p>
<h3>Treating \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as Vacuum Energy</h3>
<p>If we move \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) to the right-hand side and treat it not as a geometric term but as a vacuum energy component, the extended Einstein equation can be rewritten as:</p>
\[
\boxed{G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa\,T^{(\mathrm{matter})}_{\mu\nu} - \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\,g_{\mu\nu}}
\]<p>Defining the vacuum energy tensor as:</p>
\[
T^{(\Lambda)}_{\mu\nu} \equiv -\frac{\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{\kappa} g_{\mu\nu}
\]<p>the equation can be rearranged as:</p>
\[
G_{\mu\nu} = \kappa \Big( T^{(\mathrm{m})}_{\mu\nu} + T^{(\Lambda)}_{\mu\nu} \Big)
\]<p>Using the Bianchi identity \(\nabla^\mu G_{\mu\nu} = 0\), the conservation law for the total energy-momentum tensor automatically follows:</p>
\[
\boxed{\nabla^\mu T^{\mathrm{(total)}}_{\mu\nu} = 0}, \qquad T^{\mathrm{(total)}}_{\mu\nu} = T^{(\mathrm{m})}_{\mu\nu} + T^{(\Lambda)}_{\mu\nu}
\]<p>In other words, when \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is treated as part of the geometry, the matter term alone appears to violate local conservation. However, if the vacuum energy is included as part of the matter sector, the total system strictly satisfies the covariant conservation law. Thus, the choice of formulation simply reflects a difference in interpretation: whether \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is regarded as a purely geometric term or as part of the matter (energy-momentum) content.<br><strong>From the author's standpoint, it is recommended to treat \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as a geometric term.</strong></p>
<h3>Validity of Approximating \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as Constant on Cosmological Scales</h3>
<p>Let us now consider the spatial gradient of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)\):</p>
\[
\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}(r)=\frac{1}{R^{2}}F\!\left(\frac{r}{R}\right), \quad F(x)=\frac{4x^{2}}{(1+x^{2})^{2}}, \quad x=\frac{r}{R}.
\]<p>As shown earlier, the derivative is expressed as:</p>
\[
\boxed{\frac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr} = \frac{1}{R^{3}}\frac{dF}{dx}, \quad \frac{dF}{dx}=\frac{8x(1-x^{2})}{(1+x^{2})^{3}}}
\]<p>Within the range \(x = \mathcal{O}(1)\), the derivative \(\dfrac{dF}{dx}\) also remains of order \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) (even at its extrema, \(\left|\frac{dF}{dx}\right|_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 1.739\)). Therefore, the spatial gradient of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is characterized by:</p>
\[
\left|\frac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr}\right| \sim \frac{1}{R^{3}}\times\mathcal{O}(1)
\]<p>Thus, for a representative cosmological scale, we obtain the following order estimate:</p>
\[
\boxed{R \sim 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m} \ \Rightarrow\ \left|\dfrac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr}\right| \sim 10^{-78}\,\mathrm{m^{-3}}}
\]<p>This shows that, on cosmological scales, the spatial gradient of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is so small that it can be regarded as observationally negligible:</p>
\[
\left|\frac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr}\right| \approx 0
\]<p>Moreover, using the observed value in the \(\Lambda\)CDM model, \(\Lambda \approx 10^{-52}\,\mathrm{m^{-2}}\), together with the cosmological scale \(L \approx 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}\), even if the constant \(\Lambda\) were to vary slightly on cosmological scales, its fractional variation would be:</p>
\[
\frac{\Lambda}{L} \approx \frac{10^{-52}\,\mathrm{m^{-2}}}{10^{26}\,\mathrm{m}} \approx 10^{-78}\,\mathrm{m^{-3}}
\]<p>This is far below the threshold of direct detectability. Therefore, the previously derived estimate \(\left|\dfrac{d\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}}{dr}\right| \sim 10^{-78}\,\mathrm{m^{-3}}\) justifies the constant approximation, yet it is not so extremely small as to be regarded as a true constant when compared to \(\Lambda/L\), and thus the significance of introducing \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as a dynamical term is not undermined.</p>
<p>Therefore, under this scale and approximation, \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) can be regarded as spatially constant and treated as an effective constant \(\Lambda\). Furthermore, as noted earlier, since the exchange current \(J_r\) becomes nearly zero on cosmological scales, the apparent local violation of conservation can be effectively neglected. As a result, the following Friedmann equations are naturally recovered:</p>
\[
\boxed{H^2 \equiv \left(\frac{\dot a}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8\pi G}{3}\,\rho - \frac{k c^2}{a^2} + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}}
\]
\[
\boxed{\frac{\ddot a}{a} = -\frac{4\pi G}{3}\!\left(\rho + \frac{3P}{c^2}\right) + \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3}}
\]<p>Consequently, this theory can be consistently connected to the \(\Lambda\)CDM model and to the observations explained by its success, such as the CMB and BAO, through the Friedmann equations.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Structural Correspondence with the Higgs Mechanism</h2>
<h3>Self-Coupling Constant \(\lambda\)</h3>
<p>From the previously derived vacuum expectation value formula:</p>
\[
v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{v} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{246\,\mathrm{GeV}} \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}
\]<p>Using the natural unit conversion (\(\hbar = c = 1\)), \(\mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \approx 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
R \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3} \times 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{m} \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}
\]<p>This value matches the electroweak scale at which the Higgs boson was discovered in LHC experiments (\(\sim 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\)).</p>
<p>Furthermore, as noted in <a href="#section10">Section 10</a>, it has already been formally identified from coefficient comparison that \( \lambda = R^{2} \). Here, if we substitute the derived value \( R \approx 1.13\times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \) obtained from \( v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \), the dimension of \(\lambda\) becomes \(\mathrm{m}^2\). Therefore, it cannot be directly compared with the dimensionless self-coupling constant \(\lambda\) of the Standard Model. However, by substituting the derived relation \( v = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \) into the Standard Model expression,</p>
\[
m_h^{2} = 2\,\lambda\,v^{2} \;\Rightarrow\; \lambda = \frac{m_h^{2}}{2\,v^{2}}
\]
<p>it is naturally normalized and becomes comparable.</p>
<p>Carrying out the substitution explicitly gives,</p>
\[
\lambda = \dfrac{m_h^{2}}{2 \left( \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \right)^{2}} = \dfrac{m_h^{2}}{\dfrac{4}{R^{2}}}
\]
<p>Therefore,</p>
\[
\boxed{\;\lambda = R^{2}\,\Bigl(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\Bigr)^{2}\;}
\]
<p>which shows that the factor \(\bigl(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\bigr)^{2}\) necessarily appears as a normalization coefficient.</p>
<p>Here, in natural units \((\hbar = c = 1)\),</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>\( R \approx 1.13\times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \;\approx\; 5.75\times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \)</li>
  <li>\( m_h \approx 125\ \mathrm{GeV} \;\Rightarrow\; \dfrac{m_h}{2} \approx 62.5\ \mathrm{GeV} \)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, substituting these values gives,</p>
\[
\lambda \;=\; (5.75\times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1})^{2}\,\times\,(62.5\ \mathrm{GeV})^{2} \;\approx\; 0.129
\]
<p>which coincides with the Standard Model self-coupling constant \(\lambda \approx 0.129\) (dimensionless).</p>
<p>This means that, at the squared scale of \(10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m}\), the energy corresponding to half the Higgs mass \(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\) overlaps doubly, resulting in the generation of the Higgs boson.</p>
<h3>Conditions for Double Higgs Production</h3>
<h4>In the Standard Model:</h4>
<p>Higgs production and decay are determined by kinematic conditions (energy thresholds).</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>For a single Higgs: \( \sqrt{\hat{s}} \geq m_h \),</li>
  <li>For a double Higgs: \( \sqrt{\hat{s}} \geq 2 m_h \) is the condition for production.</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, as long as the energy is sufficient (\( \sqrt{\hat{s}} \geq 2 m_h \)), the production of \( pp \;\to\; hh \) (double Higgs) is possible. (Currently being searched for at CERN.)</p>
<h4>In the present theory:</h4>
<p>Based on the previous result:</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>From the self-coupling constant \( \lambda = R^2 \cdot \left( \dfrac{m_h}{2} \right)^2 \),<br>when “two \( \dfrac{m_h}{2} \)” overlap simultaneously within the squared scale of \( R \), a single Higgs \( h \) is produced.</li>
  <li>Therefore, for double Higgs \( hh \) production, it is necessary that “four \( \dfrac{m_h}{2} \) (two sets of two) overlap almost simultaneously within the squared region of the \( R \,(\approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m}) \) scale,” and the probability of this is extremely small, essentially close to zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, \( hh \) production is governed not by the energy threshold, but by the geometric simultaneity condition, making it practically impossible (or the production probability is far lower than the Standard Model prediction).</p>
<p>Contrasting the predictions of the two:</p>

<h3>Non-confinement of Light and Infinite Propagation</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the energy scale corresponding to this \( R \) (\( \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \ \approx 5.75 \times 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{GeV}^{-1} \)) is \( \dfrac{1}{R} \approx 174\ \mathrm{GeV} \). This gives the maximum mass scale attainable by a single particle (\( m_{\max} \leq 174\ \mathrm{GeV} \)).</p>
<p>On the other hand, from the Standard Model relation,</p>
\[
m_t = \dfrac{y_f \cdot v}{\sqrt{2}} \quad (0 \leq y_f \leq 1)
\]
<p>the Yukawa coupling is constrained to a maximum of \( y_f = 1 \), suggesting that no heavier particle can exist beyond this limit.</p>
<p>In fact, the heaviest particle observed is the top quark, with a mass of \( m_t \approx 173\ \mathrm{GeV} \) and a Yukawa coupling of \( y_t \approx 0.99 \).<br>Thus, the prediction that no single particle heavier than the top quark can exist (\( m_{\max} \leq 174\ \mathrm{GeV},\ y_f \leq 1 \)) is consistent with observations in both the fΛ framework and the Standard Model.</p>
<p>If we substitute the maximum energy scale of \( m_{\max} \approx 174\ \mathrm{GeV} \) from fΛ, we obtain:</p>
\[
y_f = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}\, m_{\max}}{v} \approx \dfrac{\sqrt{2} \times 174}{246} \approx \dfrac{246}{246} \approx 1.00
\]
<p>showing that the Yukawa coupling precisely reaches 1.</p>
<p>(↓ Solving algebraically)</p>
<p>From the Standard Model relation:</p>
\[
m_f = \dfrac{y_f \cdot v}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
<p>if we substitute \( m_f = \dfrac{1}{R} \), then</p>
\[
\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{y_f \cdot v}{\sqrt{2}} \;\Rightarrow\; y_f = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v \cdot R}
\]
<p>Since \( v = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \),</p>
\[
y_f = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R}\right) \cdot R} = 1
\]
<p>Moreover, if we remove the identification \( v = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R} \), i.e., the treatment that fixes \( R \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \), we obtain the general relation:</p>
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{y_f \cdot v}{\sqrt{2}}}
\]
<p>Here,</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing">
  <li>if the Yukawa coupling is \( y_f = 1 \), this corresponds to the maximum mass,</li>
  <li>whereas if the Yukawa coupling is \( y_f = 0 \), it means that the mass of the particle is also zero.</li>
</ul>
<p>To reproduce zero mass, substituting \( y_f = 0 \) gives,</p>
\[
\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{0 \cdot v}{\sqrt{2}}
\]
\[
\dfrac{1}{R} = 0
\]
<p><strong>which requires \( R \to \infty \).</strong></p>
<p><strong>In other words, a massless particle forces \( R \) to diverge to infinity, and thus can propagate without being confined by the Higgs field. The corresponding case is the photon, namely light itself.</strong></p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the photon has no Yukawa coupling defined, and one cannot literally substitute \( y_f = 0 \). However, since the photon does not interact with the Higgs field, it effectively follows the same consequence as the \( y_f = 0 \) case.</p>
<p><strong>Thus, this constitutes the geometric principle by which light is unaffected by the Higgs field and can travel infinitely.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the top quark has a Yukawa coupling of \( y_t \approx 0.99 \), and in this case the corresponding \( R \) is extremely close to \( 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \) (\( \sqrt{2} / v \)). (Explicit calculation gives \( R \approx 1.14 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \)).</p>
<p>Therefore, the motion of the top quark is constrained far more strongly than that of other particles at the \( 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\ \mathrm{m} \) scale, and it inevitably follows the fate of decaying near its production point.</p>
<p>In fact, the lifetime of the top quark is extremely short (about \( 5 \times 10^{-25}\ \mathrm{s} \)), and it decays before hadronization by the strong interaction can occur.<br>As a result, unlike other particles that can be observed as “roaming entities,” the top quark is characterized by decaying almost immediately in the vicinity of where it was produced.</p>
<h3 id="space-mass-connection">Connection Between Space and Mass</h3>
<p>From Einstein’s relation \(E = mc^2\), for a single particle one has \(m_f = \dfrac{E_f}{c^2}\). In the same way, if we substitute \(m_f = \dfrac{1}{R}\), the spatial (confinement) energy of a single particle is defined as:</p>
\[
\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{E_f}{c^2} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; E_f = \dfrac{c^2}{R}
\]
<p>Substituting \(E_f = m_f \cdot c^2\) (\(E = mc^2\)) into this relation gives,</p>
\[
m_f \cdot c^2 = \dfrac{c^2}{R}
\]
<p>Therefore,</p>
\[
m_f = \dfrac{1}{R}
\]
<p>which returns (circulates) back to the original expression. Thus, “mass” can be regarded simply as the conversion into mass dimension of the “narrowness of the spatial confinement scale \(R\)” imposed by the Higgs field.</p>
<p>This circulation means that the greater the mass \(m_f\), the smaller the confinement scale \(R\) in the Higgs field, which provides a particle-level explanation of spatial curvature in analogy to general relativity’s “space distortion by mass.”</p>
<p>However, based on this circulation, the actual causal direction is more naturally understood as: the narrowness of the Higgs field confinement scale \(R\) → reduced mobility → observed externally as mass.</p>
<div style="border:3px solid currentColor; padding:0.5em; border-radius:6px; line-height:2;">
<p><strong>In other words, at least for a single particle,<br>it is not that “mass causes space to curve,” but rather that “being confined by the Higgs field, the degree of confinement (the shrinking of the spatial scale \(R\)) is observed as mass.”</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>Furthermore, in general relativistic terms, when light passes through a region where space is locally curved by other particles (i.e., where \(R\) is contracted), the photon, being unconfined (\(R \to \infty\)), nevertheless follows the geodesics of that curved space(-time). Thus, light, while massless, is subject to the influence of gravity.</strong></p>
<p>(In multi-particle systems the situation becomes more complicated, so no general statement can be made. However, for considering the origin of the link between space and mass, the single-particle system is more appropriate.)</p>
<h3>Higgs Scale and Planck Scale</h3>
<p>For a single particle, since \( m = \dfrac{1}{R} \), if we substitute the Planck length \( \ell_P \approx 1.616 \times 10^{-35}\ \mathrm{m} \) into \( R \),</p>
\[
m = \frac{1}{\ell_P} \approx \frac{1}{1.616 \times 10^{-35}\ \mathrm{m}} \approx 6.19 \times 10^{34}\ \mathrm{m}^{-1}
\]<p>In natural units (\( \hbar = c = 1 \)), \( \mathrm{m}^{-1} \approx 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{GeV} \). Therefore,</p>
\[
m \approx 6.19 \times 10^{34} \times 1.97 \times 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{GeV} \approx 1.22 \times 10^{19}\ \mathrm{GeV}
\]<p>This value coincides with the standard Planck mass:</p>
\[
m_P \approx 1.22 \times 10^{19}\ \mathrm{GeV}\ (\approx 2.18 \times 10^{-8}\ \mathrm{kg})
\]<p>That is, by substituting the Planck length \( \ell_P \) into \( R \), the Planck mass \( m_P \) necessarily emerges.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Higgs scale mass and the Planck mass are connected within the same framework through the spatial confinement scale \( R \) of the Higgs field.</p>
<p>This implies that the long-standing large gap between the Higgs scale mass (\( \sim 10^2\ \mathrm{GeV} \)) and the Planck mass (\( \sim 10^{19}\ \mathrm{GeV} \))—namely, the hierarchy problem—has been given an answer.</p>
<h3>\(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\) as a Fundamental Constant</h3>
<p>From <a href="#section10">Section 10</a>, it has already been formally identified from coefficient comparison that \(\mu^2 = 2\) (dimensionless). Here, since \(\mu^2\) in the Standard Model has the dimension \([\mathrm{GeV}^2]\), a direct comparison is not possible. However, using the Standard Model relation:</p>
\[
v^2 = \frac{\mu^2}{\lambda}
\]<p>and substituting the previously obtained \(v = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R}, \quad \lambda = R^2 \cdot \left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2\), the quantities are naturally normalized and become comparable.<br>Indeed, substituting these gives,</p>
\[
\mu^2 = v^2 \lambda = \left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{R}\right)^2 \cdot \left(R^2 \cdot \left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2\right)
\]<p>Therefore,</p>
\[
\mu^2 = 2 \cdot \left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \;\; [\mathrm{GeV}^2]
\]<p>which shows that \(\bigl(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\bigr)^{2}\) inevitably appears as a normalization factor, and furthermore coincides with the Standard Model definition \(\mu^2 = \dfrac{1}{2} m_h^2 \; [\mathrm{GeV}^2]\).<br>Substituting these (\(\mu^2, \lambda\)) back into the \(\phi^2\) and \(\phi^4\) terms of the fΛ potential \(V(\phi(r))\), we obtain:</p>
\[
V(\phi(r)) = -\left(\frac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^2 + \frac{1}{4} R^2 \left(\frac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^4
\]<p>Furthermore, substituting \(R = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v}\),</p>
\[
\boxed{V(\phi(r)) = -\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^4}
\]<p>is obtained, which coincides with the Standard Model potential:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\dfrac{1}{4} m_h^2 \phi^2 + \dfrac{m_h^2}{8 v^2} \phi^4
\]<p>Thus, the Standard Model potential can be expressed in the subdivided form:</p>
\[
\boxed{V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^4}
\]<p>making it clear that it can indeed be written in this subdivided form.</p>
<h4>Generalization of the Higgs Potential</h4>
<p>The Standard Model potential, subdivided in the preceding step, is:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4}\left(\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{m_h}{2}\right)^2 \phi^4
\]<p>Here,</p>
\[
\dfrac{m_h}{2} \equiv \breve{m}, \quad \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v} \equiv R_h
\]<p>so that:</p>
\[
V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = -\breve{m}^2 \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4} R_h^2 \breve{m}^2 \phi^4
\]<p>Rearranging this yields:</p>
\[
\boxed{V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = \breve{m}^2 \left( - \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4} R_h^2 \phi^4 \right)}
\]<p>which leads to the natural unit system:</p>
\[
\boxed{\breve{m} = 1}
\]<p>that is inevitably defined to provide bidirectional consistency between mass-dimensionless and mass-dimensional formulations.<br>
By applying this natural unit system (\(\hbar = c = \breve{m} = 1\)) and simultaneously replacing \(R_h = \tfrac{\sqrt{2}}{v} \approx 1.13 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{m}\) with a more general characteristic scale \(R\), one obtains:</p>
\[
\boxed{V_{\text{Higgs}}(\phi) = - \phi^2 + \dfrac{1}{4} R^2 \phi^4}
\]<p>which can be applied directly as a dimensionless universal scalar field potential to the cosmological scale (<a href="#section4">Section 4</a>).</p>
<p>From this it follows that \(\breve{m} \equiv \dfrac{m_h}{2}\) is a fundamental constant that governs the physical laws at the Higgs scale.</p>

<h3>Vacuum Expectation Value, Higgs Boson, Z Boson, and W Boson</h3>
<h4>The Vacuum Expectation Value (VEV) as the Onset of Breaking (\(r=R=2\))</h4>
<p>The vacuum expectation value (VEV), <strong>\(v \approx 246\ \mathrm{GeV}\)</strong>, corresponds to a stable vacuum where spontaneous symmetry breaking has already occurred. Symmetry is preserved just before this point (higher energy region), and the breaking begins around \(v\). In a variational residual plot, <strong>\(r=R=2\)</strong> is the threshold (starting point) of breaking.</p>
<h4>The Higgs Boson Mass as the Peak of Breaking</h4>
<p>The Higgs boson mass, <strong>\(m_H\) (here, using natural units \(\hbar = c = 1\), denoted as \(E_H\)) \(\approx 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\)</strong>, represents the curvature of the Higgs field potential, i.e., its resistance to fluctuations. Physically, it is the most prominent excitable eigenmode in the broken vacuum—the <strong>peak of spontaneous symmetry breaking</strong>.</p>
<p>If this peak coincides with the peak position of the variational residual, the energy scale where the vacuum structure responds most strongly (\(\delta(r)\) maximum, extreme value condition breaking) aligns with the Higgs boson mass scale. Thus, the breaking peak in the residual plot and the peak of spontaneous symmetry breaking are expected to coincide.</p>
<h4>Scaling Law and General Form</h4>
<p>As noted in <a id="space-mass-connection">the previous section</a>, for a single particle:</p>
\[
\frac{1}{R} = m = E \quad (\hbar = c = 1)
\]<p>Therefore, the particle mass-energy \(E\) is inversely proportional to the characteristic scale \(R\):</p>
\[
E \propto \frac{1}{R}
\]<p>In the present model (fΛ theory), since \(R\) and \(r\) correspond to each other as dimensionless length scales, this can be rewritten as:</p>
\[
E \propto \frac{1}{r}
\]<p>Fixing \((E_v, r_v)\) as a reference point, the proportionality gives:</p>
\[
\frac{E_v}{E} = \frac{r(E)}{r_v}
\]<p>which leads to the general expression:</p>
\[
r(E) = r_v \cdot \frac{E_v}{E}
\]<p>Substituting the reference point \(r_v = R = 2,\ E_v = 246\ \mathrm{GeV}\) gives:</p>
\[
r(E) = 2 \cdot \frac{246\,\mathrm{GeV}}{E} = \frac{492\,\mathrm{GeV}}{E}
\]<p>Thus, the correspondence between the single-particle mass scale \(E\) and the dimensionless scale \(r\) is quantified.</p>
<h4>Individual Application and Numerical Calculation</h4>
<p>By substituting individual observed masses into this relation, one obtains:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Higgs Boson</strong> (\(E_H \approx 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_H = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{125\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 3.94
\]
</li>
<li>
<strong>Z Boson</strong> (\(E_Z \approx 91.2\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_Z = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{91.2\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 5.39
\]
</li>
<li>
<strong>W Boson</strong> (\(E_W \approx 80.4\ \mathrm{GeV}\))  
\[
r_W = \frac{492\ \mathrm{GeV}}{80.4\ \mathrm{GeV}} \approx 6.12
\]
</li>
</ol>
<p>An overlay of these calculated values on the variational residual plot, zoomed in on the relevant section, is shown in the figure below (also see <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> for reference).</p>
<figure style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;">
 <img src="https://misaki-kasai.github.io/paper/higgs_r_scale.PNG" style="width:100%; height:auto;" alt="Overlay of vacuum expectation value (VEV) and electroweak boson energy scales (Higgs, W, Z) on the variational residual plot">
</figure>
<p><strong>Thus, the 125 GeV Higgs mass, symbolizing spontaneous symmetry breaking, corresponds to \(r \approx 3.94\) on the residual plot, which coincides with the position of the peak of the extreme value condition at \(r \approx 4.10\).</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, Z and W bosons lie to the right of this peak, with residuals \(\delta(r) \approx 0.5\), consistent with physical intuition. This provides a consistent connection and deeper meaning to the observed Higgs scale values.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> \(r\) and \(R\) are dimensionless before output. The variational residual \(\delta(r)\) is also dimensionless, meaning \(r\) and \(R\) "borrow" units from observations for comparison. Thus, the residual plot is on dimensionless coordinates, invariant under physical scale changes (e.g., Higgs scale).</p></div>
<h3>Curvature Radius \(R_\Lambda\)</h3>
<p>In this context, in the \(\Lambda\)CDM model, the curvature radius \(R_\Lambda\) is given in terms of the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) by the following expression (in natural units \((\hbar = c = 1)\)):</p>
\[
R_\Lambda = \sqrt{\dfrac{3}{\Lambda}} \quad \left( = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} \right)
\]<p>This expression can be derived either directly from the cosmological constant term \(\Lambda\) in Einstein’s field equations or via the Friedmann equation. Physically, it represents the <strong>curvature radius of spacetime where the effect of \(\Lambda\) becomes significant</strong> — that is, the <strong>transition scale</strong> from a gravity-dominated regime to a \(\Lambda\)-dominated regime. Beyond this scale, the influence of matter and radiation becomes subdominant, and a steady accelerated expansion takes over.</p>
<p>Accordingly, within the present model, this curvature radius \(\sqrt{\dfrac{3}{\Lambda}}\) is expected to naturally emerge as a <strong>characteristic scale</strong> corresponding to the region where the scalar-field response reaches its maximum.</p>
<p>Expressing the curvature radius \(R_\Lambda\) in terms of the dimensionless radial coordinate \(r\), we obtain:</p>
\[
r_\Lambda = 2 \times \dfrac{R_\Lambda}{R} = 2\sqrt{3} \approx 3.46
\]<p style="font-size:90%;">(Here, \(\displaystyle R_\Lambda = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\Lambda}}, \quad R = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\Lambda}}\) (from <a href="#section6">Section 6</a>))</p>
<p>(↓ for clarity)</p>
\[
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} : 2 \; \left( r = R = 2 \right) = \dfrac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} : r_\Lambda
\]
\[
\dfrac{r_\Lambda}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} = \dfrac{2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\Lambda}} \quad\Rightarrow\quad r_\Lambda = 2\sqrt{3} \approx 3.46
\]<p>Overlaying this result on the variational residual plot and magnifying the relevant region yields the figure below:</p>
<figure style="max-width:600px; margin:0 auto;">
 <img src="https://misaki-kasai.github.io/paper/r_lambda_on_vari_resi.PNG" style="width:100%; height:auto;" alt="Overlay of curvature radius R_Λ on the variational residual plot">
</figure>
<p>Thus, the curvature radius \(R_\Lambda\) naturally appears as \(r \approx 3.46\) within the region of \(\Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}\) manifestation \((r = 2 \sim 4.10)\) in the variational residual plot of this model, and it is located near the peak of the extremum-condition violation.</p>
<p>Therefore, the region where the scalar-field response in this model becomes strongest coincides with the transition point in the \(\Lambda\)CDM framework where the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) starts to dominate.</p>
<p>Accordingly, both the Higgs boson mass and the curvature radius \(R_\Lambda\) are shown to converge to the peak of the variational residual \(\delta(r)\) beyond the gap between scales.</p>

<h2>Appendix: Consistency with CCC and Aeon Transition Structure</h2>
<p>From <a href="#section9">Section 9</a>, since the condition \(M c_0 = M c^2\) (\(E_{\text{rep}} = E_{\text{BH}}\)) is satisfied at the critical radius, it follows that \(c_0 = c^2\) at that point. Consequently, singularities are prohibited by the principle of energy conservation and the speed-of-light limit.</p>
<p>According to the singularity section (<a href="#section9">Section 9</a>)’s formula \(c_0 = \dfrac{GM}{r}\), in the limit \(c_0 \to 0\), the collapse diverges as \(r \to \infty\), accompanied by the scalar field \(\phi(r) \to 0\).</p>
<p>This limiting behavior implies that the entire universe is ultimately absorbed into a single black hole structure. Mathematically, this limit corresponds precisely to the aeon-to-aeon transition surface in Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC).</p>
<p>In CCC, the universe transitions through successive aeons, and this collapse-repulsion structure agrees with the conformal matching between aeons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in this model, the critical limit \(r = R \to \infty\) leads to \(\phi(r) \to 0\) and \(\delta(r \approx R) \to 0\). However, if we consider that the small nonzero residual \(\delta(r \approx R) \ne 0\) leaves a trace in the structure of space, then:</p>
<p>The next aeon does not begin in perfect symmetry. Rather, it starts as a slightly asymmetric aeon, subtly marked by the traces of the previous aeon.</p>
<h3>Generative Monism —「生成一元論」</h3>
<p>These results indicate that both the Higgs mechanism and Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) are independently derived from the same scalar-field-based potential \(V(\phi(r))\), each emerging from distinct physical principles.</p>
<p>Despite their independent origins, these two frameworks are mathematically connected in a unique and explicit manner via the same scalar structure and its limiting behavior — a relationship that exemplifies the unifying idea of <strong>「生成一元論」 (Generative Monism)</strong>.</p>
<h3>Mathematical Foundations of the Multiverse</h3>
<p>Furthermore, in this theory, all physical laws can be altered simply by changing the internal structure of \(\phi(r)\). That is, from the viewpoint of theoretical "cost-performance", this model shows extremely high compatibility with multiverse theory.</p>
<p>If one wishes to support multiverse theory and construct a universe governed by different physical laws, it becomes mathematically feasible to generate such a universe simply by replacing the internal content of \(\phi(r)\).</p>
<p>Even a universe governed by an unusual \(\phi(r)\) that leads to an internally inconsistent or meaningless structure can still be constructed mathematically.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of the Mathematical Structure</h3>
<p>These mathematical structures can be interpreted as follows:</p>
<div style="border:3px solid currentColor; padding:0.5em; border-radius:8px; margin:1rem 0; line-height:1.8;">
<ol>
  <li>In order to extend geodesics, space first responds repulsively and expands outward;</li>
  <li>This repulsive response causes the collapse of quantum fluctuations;</li>
  <li>The collapse-generated energy is locally released into space;</li>
  <li>This released energy is converted into mass (i.e., matter);</li>
  <li>As a result, gravity (i.e., attractive curvature of space) emerges.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-size: smaller;">(Here, “collapse” refers to both the transition of fluctuations into a stable state and the collapse of quantum superpositions.)</p>
<p><em>In other words, in terms of causality, the expansion of space occurs first, and as a secondary (side-effect-like) consequence, mass is generated, leading to the emergence of gravity.</em></p>
<p><em>If the present theory holds, dark matter particles and any substantive entity of dark energy will never be found; rather, they are to be interpreted as manifestations of geometric repulsive-response.</em></p>
<p>This causal sequence offers a new perspective on the process of black hole formation.</p>
<ol class="ol-spacing">
  <li>Critical transition of the scalar field \(\phi(r)\) (breaking of the variational extremum condition)</li>
  <li>Sudden emergence of a strong repulsive acceleration \(a(r)\)</li>
  <li>Potential \(V(\phi(r))\) → activation of the Higgs mechanism</li>
  <li>Massive generation of matter (the surplus part later forming galaxies)</li>
  <li>Emergence of gravitational acceleration \(g = \dfrac{GM}{r^2}\)</li>
  <li>Equilibrium of space is achieved through \(a(r) = g\), leading to a stable structure</li>
  <li>This stable structure is enclosed as the interior region of the black hole</li>
  <li>To maintain the gravitational acceleration \(g\), the system absorbs additional mass (matter) from the outside — corresponding to the overflowed mass that forms galaxies</li>
  <li>At the vicinity of the critical radius, the saturated gravitational acceleration (mass–energy) is converted back into the geometric scalar field \(\phi(r)\) via the <a href="#appendix-conservation-friedmann">exchange current \(J_r\)</a>, and is released outward as geometric temperature (heat) through the repulsive acceleration \(a_{\max}\) at the critical radius — i.e., as Hawking radiation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><a href="#planck-units">As discussed later</a>, the repulsive acceleration at the critical radius \(r = R = \dfrac{1}{2}r_s\) is given by:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = \frac{c^4}{GM}
\]<p>Meanwhile, the general-relativistic Hawking temperature, defined from the surface gravity \(\kappa_s\) at the event horizon \(r = r_s\), is expressed as:</p>
\[
T_{\mathrm{H}} = \frac{\hbar\,\kappa_s}{2\pi k_B c}, \qquad \kappa_s = \frac{c^4}{4GM}
\]<p>Comparing the coefficients in the two expressions gives:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = \frac{c^4}{GM}, \qquad \kappa_s = \frac{c^4}{4GM}
\]<p>Thus, the corresponding effective temperature scale at the critical radius becomes:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = 4\,\kappa_s \quad \Longrightarrow \quad T_{\mathrm{eff}}^{\mathrm{crit}} = 4\,T_{\mathrm{H}}
\]<p>Therefore, the acceleration at the critical radius corresponds to <strong>four times</strong> the surface gravity at the event horizon, and the Hawking temperature observed externally can be interpreted as its projection — a redshifted manifestation reduced to \(\dfrac{1}{4}\) of the internal effective temperature scale.</p>
<p>In other words, the effective geometric gradient that generates Hawking radiation is localized near the critical radius \(r_{\mathrm{crit}} = \dfrac{1}{2}r_s\) inside the black hole, appearing as the maximal point of the repulsive acceleration \(a(r)\).</p>

<h2>Remark: Derivation of the Characteristic Velocity Scale \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) from the Effective Energy of \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \)</h2>
<p>Based on the results of <a href="#section6">Section 6</a> and the vacuum energy density formula in the \( \Lambda \)CDM model, the characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \) can be derived as follows. At the characteristic scale \(r = R\), i.e., under the condition used to derive \(v_0\), we have \(\Lambda_{\text{eff}} = \Lambda\), and thus the effective energy density is given by:</p>
\[
\rho_\Lambda = \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8\pi G} \approx 10^{-26}\,\mathrm{kg/m^3}
\]<p>Assuming a spherically symmetric region of radius \( R \approx 1000\,\mathrm{kpc} \approx 3.1 \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{m} \), and noting that \( 10^{22}\,\mathrm{m} \ll 10^{26}\,\mathrm{m} \) (from <a href="#section6">Section 6</a>), we can treat \( \rho_\Lambda \) as approximately constant within this scale and compute the effective mass:</p>
\[
M_\Lambda = \rho_\Lambda \cdot \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \approx 10^{42}\,\mathrm{kg}
\]<p>We now consider the kinetic energy that would correspond to the characteristic velocity scale \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \). <strong>Here, the key idea is that we first substitute \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \), converting the effective mass \( M_\Lambda \) entirely into kinetic energy, and then assess what fraction of this energy, \( E \), is actually required. This is the true purpose of the derivation — hence the mathematical steps appear in reverse order.</strong></p>
\[
E = \frac{1}{2} M_\Lambda v_0^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_0 \approx \sqrt{\frac{2E}{M_\Lambda}} \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s}
\]<p>Thus, the characteristic velocity \( v_0 \approx 200\,\mathrm{km/s} \) naturally emerges from the framework of the \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}} \) model. The corresponding energy \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \) is consistent with observationally typical scales.</p>
<p>The total vacuum energy is estimated as \( E_\Lambda = M_\Lambda c^2 \approx 10^{59}\,\mathrm{J} \), which is significantly larger than \( E \sim 10^{52}\,\mathrm{J} \), thereby maintaining energetic consistency.</p>
<p>These results quantitatively support that the scale-dependent term \( \Lambda_{\text{eff}}(r) \), derived from the scalar field, can function as a physically plausible effective repulsive cosmological term.</p>
</section>
<h2>Appendix:<br>Fundamental Planck Units and Their Physical Reality</h2>
<p>The repulsive acceleration derived in <a href="#section9">Section 9</a> is:</p>
\[
a(r) = \dfrac{2 c_{0} r}{R^{2} + r^{2}} \quad
\]<p>At the point \( r = R \), where the function \( a(r) \) takes its maximum value:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = \dfrac{2 c_{0} R}{R^{2} + R^{2}} = \dfrac{2 c_{0} R}{2 R^{2}}
\]<p>Thus:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = \dfrac{c_{0}}{R} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \boxed{a_{\max} \cdot R = c_{0}}
\]<p>Furthermore, since \(M c_{0} = M c^{2}\), at the critical radius we have \(c_{0}^{\max} = c^{2}\).</p>
\[
a_{\max} \cdot R = c^{2}
\]<p>Substituting the critical radius obtained in <a href="#section9">Section 9</a>, \(r_{\text{crit}} = \dfrac{1}{2} r_s = \dfrac{GM}{c^{2}}\), into \(R\):</p>
\[
a_{\max} \cdot \dfrac{GM}{c^{2}} = c^{2}
\]<p>Therefore,</p>
\[
\boxed{a_{\max} = \dfrac{c^{4}}{GM}}
\]<p>Hence, both the repulsive acceleration and the gravitational acceleration inside a black hole cannot exceed this value.</p>
<p>Now, considering the Planck acceleration as the maximum acceleration:</p>
\[
a_{\mathrm{P}} \;\equiv\; \sqrt{\dfrac{c^{7}}{\hbar G}}
\]<p>and substituting the derived critical radius \(\dfrac{1}{2} r_{s} = \dfrac{GM}{c^{2}}\) into \(a_{\max}\) and \(R\), respectively, we obtain:</p>
\[
a_{\max} \cdot R = c^{2} \;\;\Rightarrow\;\; \sqrt{\dfrac{c^{7}}{\hbar G}} \cdot \dfrac{GM}{c^{2}} = c^{2}
\]<p>Solving this for the mass \( M \):</p>
\[
M = \sqrt{\dfrac{\hbar c}{G}}
\]<p>This is the Planck mass, indicating that even for a black hole compressed to the extreme Planck scale, its mass cannot exceed the Planck mass. (This corresponds to the case of \(\kappa = 1\), discussed later.)</p>
<h3>Derivation of Fundamental Planck Units from Internal Structure</h3>
<p>Here, consider the ratio of \(a_{\max}\) to \(R\):</p>
\[
\dfrac{a_{\max}}{R} = \dfrac{(c^{4} / GM)}{(GM / c^{2})} = \dfrac{c^{6}}{(GM)^{2}}
\]<p>Rearranging this gives:</p>
\[
\dfrac{a_{\max}}{R} = \dfrac{c^{5}}{G} \cdot \dfrac{c}{GM^{2}} = \dfrac{c^{5}}{G} \cdot \left(\dfrac{GM^{2}}{c}\right)^{-1}
\]<p>Since the dimensionality of \(\dfrac{GM^{2}}{c}\) coincides with that of the Dirac constant \(\hbar\), we may introduce a proportionality constant \(\kappa\):</p>
\[
\dfrac{GM^{2}}{c} = \kappa \hbar
\]<p>Substituting this into the above expression yields:</p>
\[
\dfrac{a_{\max}}{R} = \dfrac{c^{5}}{G \kappa \hbar}
\]<p>Also, since \(\dfrac{a_{\max}}{R} = \dfrac{c^{6}}{(GM)^{2}}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
\dfrac{c^{6}}{(GM)^{2}} = \dfrac{c^{5}}{G \kappa \hbar} \quad \Rightarrow \quad M^{2} = \dfrac{\kappa \hbar c}{G}
\]<p>Therefore, the physical limiting mass is:</p>
\[
\boxed{M = \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar c}{G}}}
\]
<h3>Case 1: Product × Ratio → Limiting Acceleration</h3>
\[
\text{Product} \times \text{Ratio} \;\equiv\; (a_{\max} \cdot R)\left(\dfrac{a_{\max}}{R}\right) = a_{\max}^{2} = \left(\dfrac{c^{4}}{GM}\right)^{2}
\]<p>Substituting the limiting mass \(M = \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar c}{G}}\), we obtain:</p>
\[
a_{\max}^{2} = \dfrac{c^{7}}{\kappa \hbar G}
\]<p>Thus, the physical limiting acceleration is:</p>
\[
\boxed{a_{\max} = \sqrt{\dfrac{c^{7}}{\kappa \hbar G}}}
\]
<h3>Case 2: Product ÷ Ratio → Limiting (Minimal) Length</h3>
\[
\text{Product} \div \text{Ratio} \;\equiv\; \dfrac{a_{\max} \cdot R}{a_{\max}/R} = R^{2} = \left(\dfrac{GM}{c^{2}}\right)^{2}
\]<p>Substituting the limiting mass \(M = \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar c}{G}}\), we find:</p>
\[
R^{2} = \dfrac{\kappa \hbar G}{c^{3}}
\]<p>Therefore, the physical minimal length is:</p>
\[
\boxed{R = \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar G}{c^{3}}}}
\]
<h3>Case 3: Ratio ÷ Product → Limiting Curvature</h3>
\[
\text{Ratio} \div \text{Product} \;\equiv\; \dfrac{a_{\max}/R}{a_{\max} \cdot R} = \dfrac{1}{R^{2}}
\]<p>From the result above, since \(R = \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar G}{c^{3}}}\), the physical limiting curvature scale corresponding to the dimension of the cosmological constant \(\Lambda\) is:</p>
\[
\boxed{\dfrac{1}{R^{2}} = \dfrac{c^{3}}{\kappa \hbar G}}
\]<p><strong>Since the assumption of fundamental Planck units is \(\kappa = 1\), adopting this value makes the derived limits of mass, acceleration, minimal length, and curvature identical to the known fundamental Planck units.</strong></p>
<div style="border:3px solid currentColor; padding:0.5em; border-radius:6px; line-height:2;">
<p><strong>Thus, the fundamental Planck units are not to be postulated externally, but emerge as physical realities derived from the limiting values at the critical radius inside a black hole, under the assumption \(\kappa = 1\).</strong></p>
</div>
<p>Now, let us define:</p>
\[
\boxed{v_{\max} = \sqrt{a_{\max} \cdot R}}
\]<p>Then,</p>
\[
v_{\max} = \sqrt{\sqrt{\dfrac{c^{7}}{\kappa \hbar G}} \cdot \sqrt{\dfrac{\kappa \hbar G}{c^{3}}}}
\]<p><strong>From this expression, it is clear that the factors of \(\kappa\) cancel out, so the resulting limiting velocity is invariant, regardless of the value of \(\kappa\).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thus, the absolute value of the limiting velocity is guaranteed to remain unchanged even if \(\kappa\) is varied, while the specific value of \(\kappa\) may be determined from external requirements associated with other physical limits (limiting mass, limiting acceleration, minimal length, limiting curvature).<br>(That is, the real universe does not necessarily require \(\kappa = 1\).)</strong></p>
<p>If \(\kappa\) is taken to be smaller than 1:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The limiting mass becomes lighter</li>
  <li>The limiting acceleration becomes stronger</li>
  <li>The minimal length becomes shorter</li>
  <li>The limiting curvature becomes larger</li>
  <li>The limiting velocity remains unchanged (always \(c\))</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<ul class="ol-spacing" style="padding-left:1em; margin-left:0;">
  <li>\(\kappa = 1\): coincides with the fundamental Planck units, producing the most symmetric case without extra factors</li>
  <li>\(\kappa &lt; 1\): a world where quantum effects are enhanced</li>
  <li>\(\kappa &gt; 1\): a more classical world where physical limits are relaxed</li>

<p><strong>In this sense, \(\kappa\) can be regarded as a tuning parameter governing the balance between quantum and classical regimes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However, only when \(\kappa = 1\) do all the physical limits coincide without correction factors, making \(\kappa = 1\) the most natural choice theoretically.</strong></p>
<h3>Geometrical Essence of the Compton Wavelength \(\lambda\) and Its Generalization</h3>
<p>As noted in <a href="#space-mass-connection">the previous section</a>, the derived relation among geometry, mass, and energy is:</p>
<div>
\[
\frac{c^{2}}{R} = mc^{2} = E \quad (\, \boxed{\;\hbar = c = 1\;} \,)
\]
<p><small>Note: In natural units, \( c \) can be omitted by setting it dimensionless to 1. However, \( c \) is kept here to preserve the familiar form of the expression. Importantly, the physical light speed \(3.0\times10^{5}\ \mathrm{km/s}\) cannot be directly substituted into this \( c \).</small></p>
</div>
<p>Here, in order to convert from natural units (\(\hbar = c = 1\)) to the SI system (\(\hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{J \cdot s},\; c \approx 2.998 \times 10^{8}\ \mathrm{m/s}\)), the relation between mass and the characteristic length scale is simply a unit conversion:</p>
\[
m \times \frac{c}{\hbar} = \frac{1}{R} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad R \times \frac{c}{\hbar} = \frac{1}{m} \quad (\hbar \neq 1, \, c \neq 1)
\]<p>Thus, the conversion is:</p>
\[
\boxed{R = \dfrac{\hbar}{mc} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad m = \dfrac{\hbar}{R c}} \quad (\hbar \neq 1, \, c \neq 1)
\]<p>Applying this to the earlier relation yields:</p>
\[
\frac{\hbar}{R c} \cdot c^{2} = mc^{2} = E \quad (\hbar \neq 1, \, c \neq 1)
\]<p>Therefore:</p>
\[
\boxed{\begin{array}{c}\dfrac{\hbar c}{R} = mc^{2} = E \\[0.6em]\text{SI units: }\hbar \approx 1.055 \times 10^{-34}\ \mathrm{J \cdot s},\; c \approx 2.998 \times 10^{8}\ \mathrm{m/s} \end{array}}
\]<p>Furthermore, \(R = \dfrac{\hbar}{mc}\) coincides with the Compton wavelength:</p>
\[
\lambda_{\mathrm{C}} \equiv \frac{\hbar}{mc}
\]<p>Thus, for a single particle, \(R\) and \(\lambda_{\mathrm{C}}\) can be identified.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized, however, that the Compton wavelength \(\lambda_C\) is inherently a scale associated with a <em>massive particle</em>, and it cannot be directly applied to field scales such as the vacuum expectation value \(v\) in the Standard Model or cosmological scales.</p>
<p><strong>Accordingly, \(R\) can be understood as a generalization of the concept of the Compton wavelength to the binding scale of the Higgs field, and further to a more universal characteristic scale.</strong></p>
<p>To check consistency, substituting \(R = \dfrac{\hbar}{m c}\) into the relation given in <a href="#planck-units">the previous section</a>:</p>
\[
a_{\max} \cdot R = c^2
\]<p>yields:</p>
\[
a_{\max} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{mc} = c^2
\]<p>Therefore:</p>
\[
\boxed{a_{\max} = \frac{mc^3}{\hbar}}
\]<p>Substituting the Planck mass \( m_{\mathrm{P}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\hbar c}{G}}\) gives:</p>
\[
a_{\max} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar c}{G}} \cdot \frac{c^3}{\hbar} = \sqrt{\frac{c^7}{\hbar G}}
\]<p>which correctly reproduces the Planck acceleration:</p>
\[
a_{\mathrm{P}} = \sqrt{\frac{c^7}{\hbar G}}
\]<p>Therefore, the Compton wavelength \(\lambda_C\) is the specific representation of the characteristic scale \(R\) when applied to a single particle, and can be regarded as essentially equivalent to the Higgs field binding scale \(R_f\). Namely:</p>
\[
\boxed{\, \lambda_{\mathrm{C}} \equiv R_{f} = \frac{\hbar}{mc} \,}
\]
